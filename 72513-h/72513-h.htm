<p>The following pages, from which an excerpt was
published in 1913, under the title—The Railroad
The Conqueror—constitute an attempt to put within
short compass the main causes of the shifting
sectionalism of the people of the United States.</p>

<p>The facts and assertions upon which this sketch
is based have, with others not included, been gathered
and pondered for at least sixteen years, during
which period, much at times interwoven, has, from
time to time been cut, for fear that consideration
of such might lead the thoughts of the possible
reader away from the main theme.</p>

<p>As to the workmanship few can see more clearly
than the author, how much better that could have
been, had he who undertook it been accommodated
with more leisure and equipped with scholarship
and means. Yet it is doubtful if any one could
have approached the task and pursued it through
the years which have intervened between its inception
and completion with a firmer determination
to present the truth and nothing but the truth, as
the writer saw and still sees it.</p>

<p>To publish what is herein set out, in this day of
rampant commercialism and often unconscious intolerance,
requires character and courage in a publisher.</p>

<p>On the other hand, submission to some, holding
themselves out as publishers and soliciting manuscripts,
involves occasional risk, and in this connection,
the author feels that he would be lacking
in ordinary gratitude, did he not record the rescue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
of this manuscript, in an earlier form, from the
clutch of a publishing house, which having obtained
it on solicitation, for perusal and consideration, on
terms declined, held it for a year, in spite of repeated
requests for its return, replied to repeatedly,
with untruthful assertions that it had been sent
back. Without any knowledge of or interest in the
contents, a stranger, to whose inquiries concerning
local history, the author, from time to time had replied,
C. W. Lewis, Esq., residing in the vicinity of
the disreputable publishing house, upon request, by
a personal call, forced the delivery of the manuscript
and returned it to the author. Now complete
it is submitted to the public without further comment
to speak for itself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p>In consideration of much that appears in the
numerous contributions to the discussion of the
Negro Question, it must be noticeable that in recent
years, there has been quite a broadening of the field,
and that, from what was in the past, mainly a question
of slavery or freedom, for one particular class
of people, in one great country, we have advanced to
a consideration of what may effect the entire world
in that, which has been entitled by some: “The Conflict
of Color,” and by others not quite so pessimistic:
“The Question of the Twentieth Century, the
Question of Color.”</p>

<p>In such circumstances, an examination of the
evolution of this question and a recital of some of
the phases under which it has been brought up for
discussion in the history of the United States, may
tend to correct some misapprehensions and throw
some additional light upon a subject, which, in
spite of the efforts to suppress it, is continually forcing
itself upon the attention of the world.</p>

<p>While freely admitting the impossibility of discussing
this subject, within any reasonable limits,
without necessarily omitting mention of many publications,
containing an amount of extremely valuable
information, the aim of this work will be to
trace the evolution of the question as it has appeared,
in the expression of both whites and Negroes,
in that country in which public opinion is said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
to exercise the greatest influence upon government.
In undertaking such an examination it would be
hardly necessary to make any very close scrutiny of
the Colonial period, from the fact that while there
was opinion that found expression in acts, statements
and laws, the colonies, being under the control
of Great Britain, were subjected to her policies and
representative of her civilization. The extraordinary
case therefore of a Massachusetts slave-owner,
Maverick, who simply for breeding purposes, in
1636, forced an African woman of high rank, owned
by him, to accept the embraces of a common young
Negro<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was but a way of expressing contempt for the
race. The Maryland Act of 1663, a far less coarse
expression, involved all white women who failed to
entertain it. In Stroud’s “Sketch of the laws of
Slavery,” published in 1827, we find on page 2:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Section 2. And forasmuch as divers free born English
women forgetful of their free condition, and to the disgrace
of our nation do intermarry with Negro slaves” such “free
born women ... shall serve the master of such slave during
the life of her husband and all the issue of such free
born women, so married shall be slaves as their fathers
were.”</p>
</div>

<p>Yet despite these two striking illustrations at these
early dates, broadly speaking, we might claim that
in British America “up to 1700 and perhaps beyond,
the sentiment North and South concerning the Negro
or his enslavement differed but slightly; for
while the South Carolina Act of 1690 did provide
severe regulations for Negro and Indian slaves, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
study of the statutes from 1698”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> “and later of the
press, indicates a sentiment against the importation
of Negroes, which however was forced upon that
province, as upon others, by the British Government.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The Revolutionary war, which shook off this controlling
force, associated the States together, under
the Articles of Confederation, thus paving the way
for that great experiment, the Constitutional Federal
Republic, which succeeded it.</p>

<p>It was in the deliberations of the great Convention,
which framed that “more perfect union”, that
the Negro question really first arose, as a matter
of vital political concern; nor among all the questions
which confronted that extraordinary body, did
there appear a graver one, than that affecting the
status of the colored people of the Union.</p>

<p>This class represented, at that time, about one-fifth
of the population of the thirteen States, which
it was the aim to unite, or 737,208 blacks as against
3,172,006 whites<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, and while of these 737,208 colored
persons some 59,527 were free, in every one of the
thirteen States, except Massachusetts, there were
slaves, and in only one State, outside of New England,
Pennsylvania, were free persons of color more
numerous than slaves.</p>

<p>In eight of the thirteen States the Negro slaves
greatly outnumbered the free persons of color; while
in still another, with a total of 5,572 colored persons,
the colored freedmen exceeded the slaves by only 54.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>Under these conditions, it was not unnatural that
the question should have presented itself as one of
slavery versus freedom, rather than Negroes versus
whites, and for the seventy years in which slavery
continued to exist, that fact served to obscure, to
quite an extent, the appreciation of the distinct
question of color and race. Yet by some, at an exceedingly
early date, it was recognized, that apart
from the consideration of how they might be held,
the mere presence in the Republic of a large and
growing number of people of an inferior race, presented
a serious problem.</p>

<p>When the consideration of the basis upon which
Federal representation should rest, and direct taxes
be apportioned, was reached, the framers of the Constitution
found themselves, therefore, confronted
with a political question of the first magnitude, in
the existence of the slave trade.</p>

<p>What was the slave? A man or a chattel?</p>

<p>The question was precipitated by a clause in
the report of the committee of detail, presented by
John Rutledge, of South Carolina, Article 7, Section
4. “No tax or duty shall be laid by the Legislature
on articles exported from any State nor on the
migration or importation of such persons as the
several States shall think proper to admit, nor shall
such migration or importation be prohibited.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In the light of what followed, of the existing legislation
upon that subject in the State of South
Carolina, and the history of the province and State,
the introduction of the concluding clause of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
section by her most distinguished representative was
unfortunate. It gave rise to declarations concerning
the State which not only do not seem to have
been absolutely borne out by the facts; but which
the actions and votes of her deputies themselves, to
some extent stultified; yet the State was nevertheless
stamped with an unenviable precedence in a
matter in which she cast but one of the seven votes,
in a total of eleven, by which the final decision was
arrived at.</p>

<p>In the discussion which immediately arose upon
the introduction of the report, four views with regard
to this clause found expression.</p>

<p>Luther Martin, of Maryland, a Representative
from a State, which, as will subsequently be shown,
could have then been described as the most complete
slave State of the thirteen, had nevertheless the
discernment to realize the dangers of such a condition,
and proposed to alter the section, so as to allow
a prohibition or tax on the importation of slaves.
He presented three grounds of objection to the
denial of such: “1. As five slaves are to be counted
as three free-men in the apportionment of Representatives,
such a clause would leave an encouragement
of the traffic. 2. Slaves weakened one part of
the Union, which the other parts were bound to protect;
the privilege of importing them was, therefore,
unreasonable. 3. It was inconsistent with the principles
of the Revolution and dishonorable to the
American character to have such features in the
Constitution.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>In defending the clause Mr. Rutledge was not conciliatory.
He “did not see how the importation of
slaves could be encouraged by this section. He was
not apprehensive of insurrections and would readily
exempt the other States from their obligations to
protect the Southern States against them. Religion
and humanity had nothing to do with the question.
Interest alone is the governing principle with
nations. The true question at present is whether
the Southern States shall or shall not be parties to
the Union. If the Northern States consult their
interest they will not oppose the increase of slaves
which will increase the commodities of which they
will become the consumers.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth of Connecticut supported the clause
in an argument pitched upon the same utilitarian
plane, but strengthened with what was an assertion
of the doctrine of States rights. He “was for leaving
the clause as it stands. Let every State import
what it pleases. The morality or wisdom of slavery
are considerations belonging to the States themselves.
What enriches a part enriches the whole,
and the States are the best judges of their particular
interests. The old Confederation had not meddled
with this point and he did not see any greater necessity
for bringing it within the policy of the new
one.”</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Pinckney, of South Carolina, while
upholding the view of Mr. Rutledge, held out a hope
of subsequent accord. He said “South Carolina
can never receive the plan, if it prohibits the slave
trade. In every proposed extension of the powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
of Congress, that State has expressly and watchfully
excepted that of meddling with the importation of
Negroes. If the States be all left at liberty on the
subject, South Carolina may perhaps by degrees do
of herself what is wished, as Virginia and Maryland
have already done.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Upon the following day the discussion was resumed.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman, of Connecticut, “was for leaving
the clause as it stands. He disapproved of the
slave trade; yet as the States were now possessed
of the right to import slaves, as the public good
did not require it to be taken from them and as it
was expedient to have as few objections as possible
to the proposed scheme of Government, thought it
best to leave the matter as we found it. He observed
that the abolition of slavery seemed to be
going on in the United States, and that the good
sense of the several States would probably by degrees
complete it. He urged upon the Convention
the necessity of dispatching its business.”</p>

<p>Col. Mason, of Virginia, took very high ground.
He declared: “This infernal traffic originated in the
avarice of the British merchants. The British Government
constantly checked the attempts of Virginia
to put a stop to it. The present question concerns
not the importing States alone, but the whole
Union. The evil of having slaves was experienced
during the late war. Had slaves been treated as
they might have been by the enemy, they would have
proved dangerous instruments in their hands. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
their folly dealt by the slaves as it did by the Tories.
He mentioned the dangerous insurrections of the
slaves in Greece and Sicily, and the instructions
given by Cromwell to the commissioners sent to
Virginia to arm the servants and slaves in case
other means of obtaining submission should fail.
Maryland and Virginia, he said, had already prohibited
the importation of slaves expressly. North
Carolina had done the same in substance. All this
would be vain, if South Carolina and Georgia be
at liberty to import. The Western people are already
calling out for slaves in their new lands, and
will fill that country with slaves, if they can be got
through South Carolina and Georgia. Slavery discourages
arts and manufactures. The poor despise
labor when performed by slaves. They prevent
the immigration of whites, who really enrich and
strengthen a country. They produce the most pernicious
effect on morals. Every master of slaves
is born a petty tyrant. They bring the judgment of
Heaven on a country. As nations cannot be rewarded
or punished in the next world they must be
in this. By an inevitable chain of causes and effects
Providence punishes national sins by national calamities.
He lamented that some of our Eastern
brethren had, from a lust of gain, embarked in this
nefarious traffic. As to the States being in possession
of the right to import, this was the case with
many other rights now to be properly given up.
He held it essential in every point of view that the
General Government should have power to prevent
the increase of slavery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Ellsworth spoke again, and quite to the point:
“As he had never owned a slave, could not judge
of the effect of slavery on character. He said,
however, that if it was to be considered in a moral
light, we ought to go further and free those already
in the country. As slaves also multiply so fast in
Virginia and Maryland that it is cheaper to raise
than import them, whilst in the sickly swamps foreign
supplies are necessary. If we go no further
than is urged we shall be unjust to South Carolina
and Georgia. Let us not intermeddle. As population
increases, poor laborers will be so plenty as
to render slaves useless. Slavery in time will not
be a speck in our country. Provision is already
made in Connecticut for abolishing it. And the
abolition has already taken place in Massachusetts.
As to the danger of insurrection from foreign influence
that will become a motive to kind treatment
of the slaves.”</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Pinckney said: “If slavery be wrong
it is justified by the example of all the world. He
cited the case of Greece, Rome and other States;
the sanction given by France, England, Holland and
other modern States. In all ages one half of mankind
have been slaves. If the Southern States were
left alone they will probably of themselves stop
importation. He would himself, as a citizen of
South Carolina, vote for it. An attempt to take
away the right, as proposed, will produce serious
objections to the Constitution which he wished to
see adopted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Gen. C. C. Pinckney “declared it to be his firm
opinion that if himself and all his colleagues were
to sign the Constitution and use their personal influence
it would be of no avail towards obtaining
the assent of their constituents. South Carolina
and Georgia cannot do without slaves. As to Virginia,
she will gain by stopping the importations.
Her slaves will rise in value and she has more than
she wants. It would be unequal to require South
Carolina and Georgia to confederate on such unequal
terms. He said the royal assent before the
Revolution had never been refused to South Carolina
as to Virginia. He contended that the importation
of Slaves would be for the interest of the Whole
Union. The more slaves the more produce to employ
the carrying trade. The more consumption
also, and the more of this the more of revenue for
the common treasury. He admitted it to be reasonable
that slaves should be dutied like other imports,
but should consider a rejection of the clause
as an exclusion of South Carolina from the Union.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin, of Georgia, “had conceived national
objects alone to be before the Convention, not such
as like the present were of a local nature. Georgia
was decided on this point. That State has always
hitherto supposed a General Government to be the
pursuit of the central States who wished to have a
vortex for everything—that her distance would preclude
her from equal advantage—and that she could
not prudently purchase it by yielding national powers.
From this it might be understood in what light
she would view an attempt to abridge her favorite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
prerogative. If left to herself she may probably
put a stop to the evil. As one ground for this conjecture
he took notice of the sect of which he said
was a respectable class of people who carried their
ethics beyond the mere equality of men, extending
their humanity to the claims of the whole animal
creation.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson, of Pennsylvania, “observed that if
South Carolina and Georgia were themselves disposed
to get rid of the importation of slaves in a
short time, as had been suggested, they would never
refuse to unite because the importation might be
prohibited. As the section now stands all articles
imported are to be taxed. Slaves alone are exempt.
This is in fact a bounty on that article.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gerry, of Massachusetts, “thought we had
nothing to do with the conduct of the States as to
slaves, but ought to be careful not to give any sanction
to it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dickinson, of Delaware, “considered it as
inadmissible on every principle of honor and safety
that the importation of slaves should be authorized
to the States by the Constitution. The true question
was whether the national happiness would be
promoted or impeded by the importation, and the
question ought to be left to the National Government,
not to the States particularly interested. If
England and France permit slavery, slaves are at
the same time excluded from both these kingdoms.
Greece and Rome were made unhappy by their
slaves. He could not believe that the Southern
States would refuse to confederate on the account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
apprehended; especially as the power was not likely
to be immediately exercised by the General Government.”</p>

<p>Mr. Williamson, of North Carolina, “stated the
law of North Carolina on the subject, to wit, that
it did not directly prohibit the importation of slaves.
It imposed a duty of five pounds on each slave imported
from Africa. Ten pounds on each from elsewhere,
and fifty pounds on each from a State licensing
manumission. He thought the Southern States
could not be members of the Union if the clause
should be rejected, and that it was wrong to force
anything down not absolutely necessary and which
any State must disagree to.”</p>

<p>Mr. King, of Massachusetts, “thought the subject
should be considered in a political light only.
If two States will not agree to the Constitution as
stated on one side, he could affirm with equal belief
on the other that great and equal opposition
would be experienced from the other States. He remarked
on the exemption of slaves from duty, while
every other import was subjected to it, as an inequality
that could not fail to strike the commercial
sagacity of the Northern and Middle States.”</p>

<p>Mr. Langdon, of New Hampshire, “was strenuous
for giving the power to the General Government.
He could not with a good conscience leave it with
the States who could then go on with the traffic,
without being restrained by the opinion here given
that they will themselves cease to import slaves.”</p>

<p>Gen. Pinckney, “thought himself bound to declare
candidly that he did not think South Carolina would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
stop her importation of slaves in any short time,
but only stop them occasionally as she now does.
He moved to commit the clause that slaves might
be made liable to an equal tax with other imports,
which he thought right, and which would remove
one difficulty that had been started.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rutledge remarked: “If the Convention
thinks that North Carolina, South Carolina and
Georgia will ever agree to the plan, unless their
right to import slaves be untouched, the expectation
is vain. The people of these States will never
be such fools as to give up so important an interest.
He was strenuous against striking out the
section and seconded the motion of Gen. Pinckney
for a commitment.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gouverneur Morris, of Pennsylvania, “wished
the whole subject to be committed, including the
clauses relating to taxes on exports, and on a Navigation
Act. These things may form a bargain
among the Northern and Southern States.”</p>

<p>Mr. Butler, of South Carolina, declared, “that he
would never agree to the power of taxing exports.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman said: “It was better to let the Southern
States import slaves than to part with them, if
they made that a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i>. He was opposed to
a tax on slaves imported as making the matter
worse, because it implied they were property. He
acknowledged that if the power of prohibiting the
importation should be given to the General Government
that it would be exercised. He thought it
would be its duty to exercise the power.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Reed, of Delaware, “was for the commitment
provided the clause concerning taxes on exports
should also be committed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman, observed: “that that clause had
been agreed to and therefore could not be committed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph, of Virginia, “was for committing
in order that some middle ground, if possible, be
found. He could never agree to the clause as it
stands. He would sooner risk the Constitution.
He dwelt on the dilemma to which the Constitution
was exposed by agreeing to the clause it would revolt
the Quakers, the Methodists and many others
in the States having no slaves. On the other hand,
two States might be lost to the Union. Let us then,”
he said, “try the chance of a commitment.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>On the question of committing, the vote was:
New Hampshire, no; Massachusetts, abstaining from
voting; Connecticut, aye; New Jersey, aye; Pennsylvania,
no; Delaware, no; Maryland, aye; Virginia,
aye; North Carolina, aye; South Carolina,
aye; Georgia, aye;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In a total of eleven States at
Convention seven ayes, three noes, one not voting.</p>

<p>The clause having been referred to a committee
consisting of Messrs. Langdon, King, Johnson, Livingston,
Clymer, Dickinson, L. Martin, Madison, Williamson,
C. C. Pinckney, and Baldwin, the committee
reported in favor of the clause, with an amendment
making it read: “The migration or importation
of such persons as the several States now existing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited
by the Legislature prior to the year 1800,
but a tax or duty may be imposed on such migration
or importation at a rate not exceeding the average
of the duties laid on imports.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Gen. Pinckney moved to strike out the words “the
year 1800 and to insert the words eighteen hundred
and eight.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gorham, of Massachusetts, seconded the motion.
This action brought from one, who up to that
time does not appear to have participated in the discussion,
Mr. Madison, the declaration that: “twenty
years will produce all the mischief that can be apprehended
from the liberty to import slaves. So
long a term will be more dishonorable to the national
character than to say nothing about it in the Constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The reported clause had been referred to the committee
against the vote of New Hampshire, Pennsylvania,
and Delaware. Virginia and New Jersey
both opposed the amendment; but as it received the
vote of both New Hampshire and Massachusetts,
which had not voted for the commitment, it was
supported by seven out of the eleven States, the
three New England States present and four of the
five Southern States, the three Middle States present,
and one Southern State, opposing.</p>

<p>While reasonable men must always be alive to the
necessity of compromise, and while also the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
responsibilities of the situation concerning this matter
are apparent, yet this most important discussion
and vote establishes some facts, with regard to the
constitutional Union, which the honest historian
cannot disregard.</p>

<p>First: The migration or importation of Negroes
was prohibited in spite of the declaration of the
representatives of the three Southern States, North
Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, that some
of the Southern States could not accept the Constitution
if it did.</p>

<p>Second: A tax upon the importation was imposed
through the aid of the vote of New England, whose
representatives had warned the Convention that it
would be a recognition of slavery to tax importation.
The claim, therefore made, that South Carolina
and Georgia forced the recognition of the slave
trade is not borne out by the facts in the case.
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maryland,
North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia
followed the suggestion of Gouverneur Morris of
Pennsylvania, and, abandoning the principles for
which they had contended, “formed a bargain” by
which the slave trade was surrendered for the recognition
of slavery by the Constitution.</p>

<p>Upon considering the discussion, although Ellsworth’s
shrewd criticism crippled, to some extent,
the lofty flight of Mason of Virginia, yet the speech
of the latter puts him upon a higher plane of statesmanship
than that occupied by any deputy present.
On the other hand, no matter how high their reputations
otherwise may have been established, none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
descended to so low a plane as King, of Massachusetts
and Rutledge of South Carolina; while no individual
exhibited as much ignorance of the existing
situation as he, who by the temperance of his
utterance and the influence of his high personal
character, most thoroughly mastered it.</p>

<p>Gen. C. C. Pinckney did not seem to know that
South Carolina had not been permitted by Great
Britain to throw off the slave trade, when, as a
province, she sought to do so,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> or that the sentiment
of the people of his State, even while he was speaking,
had found expression in an Act which prohibited
the bringing into the State of “any Negro slave
contrary to the Act to regulate the recovery of
debts and prohibiting the importation of Negroes”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
and which was sufficiently strong even after the
above compromise to negative, by a vote of 93 to 40,
Gillon’s attempt in the South Carolina Legislature
in 1788, to repeal the law prohibiting importation.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
No severer criticism of the General’s statesmanship
on this point was ever promulgated than that, thirty-four
years later, which his devoted brother, Gen.
Thomas Pinckney, furnished, in some reflections,
published by him<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> without any thought of how
positively they ran counter to the dictum of his
brother—“South Carolina and Georgia cannot do
without slaves”—he warned South Carolinians that
Negro artisans were taking the places of whites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>But, turning from this discussion, it is of importance
to consider just how the Negro population of
the United States was located at the time of the
adoption of the Constitution.</p>

<p>By the census taken in 1790 it was indicated that
about six-sevenths of the entire colored population
of the thirteen States constituting the Union, inhabited
the four States of Maryland, Virginia, North
Carolina and South Carolina, of which about one-half
were found in Virginia, the population in the
order of their numbers being as follows: Virginia
305,493; Maryland 111,099; South Carolina, 108,895;
North Carolina, 105,547. The Negro population
of Georgia at that date was but slightly in excess
of the Negro population of New York, being
only 29,662 to New York’s 25,978, while in the
region north of Maryland there were nearly three
times as many Negroes as in the region south of
South Carolina.</p>

<p>Considering the percentage of blacks to whites
in the different sections, South Carolina had the
greatest, with a colored population rising as high as
44 per cent of the total. Virginia came second, with
a percentage of 41, Georgia was third, with 36;
Maryland fourth, with 35; North Carolina fifth,
with 27; Delaware sixth, with 26; New Jersey
seventh, with 9; New York eighth, with 8; Rhode
Island ninth, with 7, and Pennsylvania tenth, with
less than three per cent.</p>

<p>There is still another standpoint, however, from
which this population might be considered; that is
with regard to the area of the State containing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
same, and considered in this light, Maryland, with a
Negro population in excess of that of South Carolina,
and with an area of only one-third, was the
most distinct Negro State of the Union. Delaware
came second, and Virginia third. In the two States
of Maryland and Virginia, with a combined area of
79,124 square miles, there was considerably more
than one-half of the colored population of the United
States, 416,572. In the region to the south, embracing
the three States of North Carolina, South
Carolina and Georgia, with an area of 143,040
square miles, there were as yet but 244,104 Negroes,
or about one-third of the number, considered with
regard to the area they inhabited, which makes
very obvious the contention of Ellsworth that the
abrogation of the slave trade would have operated
as a distinct commercial benefit to Maryland and
Virginia, enabling them to supply to the region
south of them, at enhanced prices, the slaves they
might raise for market.</p>

<p>Virginia, Maryland and Delaware then constituted
at this time the black belt, containing, as they
did, four-sevenths of the colored population of the
Union, three-fourths of the remainder being in the
region below and one-fourth above.</p>

<p>In the first decade of the Constitution the density
of this colored population in Virginia and Maryland
was actually increased; while, at the same time,
through an extraordinary accession to her white
population, in spite of great gains to the colored,
South Carolina’s colored percentage decreased, and
it is on this account that what happened in the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
decade of the Constitution in South Carolina is of
so much importance. A consideration of these
events will show, that, in spite of the declaration of
her great deputies, that “South Carolina could not
do without slaves,” and that her people “would
never be such fools as to give up so important an
interest” as “their right to import slaves,” they
not only proposed to give up the right, but strove
earnestly to do so, and only after thirty years of unavailing
effort, accompanied by an ever increasing
investment in that class of property, did the strong
minority, which had opposed it, acquiesce in Calhoun’s
most unwise view, that the blacks furnished
“the best substratum of population, upon which
great and flourishing Commonwealths may be most
easily and safely reared.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Once it was accepted, the march was steadily on
to disaster.</p>

</div>


<p>Following Gillon’s unsuccessful attempt in 1788,
to repeal the existing law, the State of South Carolina,
by successive enactments, in spite of the implied
sanction of the Constitution until 1808, prohibited
the importation of slaves<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> up to the year
1803. In that year Governor James B. Richardson,
in his annual message to the General Assembly, indirectly
suggested the repeal of such legislation.</p>

<p>The language of this message is so involved that,
considered without reference to its effect, it seems
to indicate some sympathy with the prohibition of
the importation; but carefully considered, the secret
sympathy of this official with those he condemns is
obvious. The promptness with which it was seized
upon by the opponents of prohibition, and the arguments
culled from it, indicate that it was the opening
wedge by which the defence against the black
flood, was split, to admit it in such volume, as to
make subsequent efforts to stop the flow almost
useless.</p>

<p>That portion of the message which dealt with the
importation of Negro slaves reads as follows:</p>

<p>“All possible diligence and my best efforts have
been used to carry effectually into operation the law
prohibiting the importation of Negroes into the
State, but it is with concern that I have here to
state to you, that it has been without success;
whether it must be attributed principally to the ill
consequences that are apprehended would result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
from carrying the law into operation by emancipating
the Negroes so brought in (a remedy deemed
more mischievous than the evil of their introduction
in servitude) or whether the interests of the
citizens is so interwoven with that species of property,
that it prevents their aiding the law in answering
the salutary purposes, I will not presume to
determine; but I am inclined to believe both causes
operate as preventatives; for those people are continued
to be brought into the State beyond the possibility
of prevention. In all laws intended for the
general benefit, they should be so calculated that
their operation should be found equal in every part
of the State; where this is not the case it means that
there is some radical defect therein, or it is inimical
to the interest of the citizens; with this law such is
the situation; for in the present state of things, the
citizens in the frontier and sea coast districts do accumulate
this property without the possibility of
being detected, while those of the interior and middle
districts only experience the operation of that
law from their remote situation, etc.... This indeed
is a circumstance to be lamented, but such is
the true state of our situation and therefore becomes
a subject worthy of your consideration and one that
I trust will engage your endeavors to render equally
energetic in every part of the State that law which
experience has proved partial in its operation and
is oppressive upon such citizens in the interior districts
as hold it the object of desire to augment their
capital in the accumulation of such property.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>This expression of opinion from the Governor
brought up in the House the appointment of “a committee
to inquire whether any and what amendments
are necessary, to the Act entitled, ‘An Act to prevent
Negro slaves from being brought into or entering
this State’<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; in the Senate a bill to permit
their importation.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The leading opponent in the Senate of the bill to
permit importation was State Senator Robert Barnwell,
at that time in his forty-second year. He had
served with credit in the Revolutionary war, in the
course of which he had been seriously wounded; had
been a delegate to the Continental Congress; and
later a member of Congress from the 2nd Congressional
district of South Carolina, later still he had
been elected Speaker of the South Carolina House
of Representatives.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He is described by Edward
Hooker as “a tall, portly, well-built man of about
sixty years—a man of singular gravity, and possessed
of great influence in the Senate. Said to be
an eminent orator and very religious character.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>A synopsis of Mr. Barnwell’s remarks on this occasion
has been preserved, although, as became more
and more the custom with regard to all utterances
concerning slavery, in any way critical, much was
suppressed. The account reads as follows: “He
maintained that by the immense influx of these persons
into the State, the value of this species of property
would be considerably diminished, insomuch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
that he did believe Negroes would be soon not worth
one half of what they might be sold for. The
value of the produce raised by their labor would be
in like manner depreciated. * * * The permission
given by the bill would lead to ruinous speculation.
Everyone would purchase Negroes. It was well
known that those who dealt in this property would
sell it at a very long credit. Our citizens would
purchase at all hazards and trust to fortunate crops
and favorable markets for making their payments
and it would be found that South Carolina would in
a few years, if this trade continued open, be in the
same situation of debt, and subject to all the misfortunes
which that situation had produced as at
the conclusion of the Revolutionary war. The honorable
member adduced in support of his opinion
other arguments still more cogent and impressive,
which from reasons very obvious, we decline making
public.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The most prominent advocate of the bill was State
Senator William Smith, the schoolmate of Andrew
Jackson, later judge, and, later still, United States
Senator, the most determined of Calhoun’s political
opponents in after years. He was a native of
North Carolina, of somewhat indefinite age, a reformed
drunkard; but a man of firmness and power,
and also of pleasing appearance.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The report of his remarks upon this occasion is
brevity itself, but sufficient to condemn him, as it is
apparent that in a spirit of pessimism he voted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
against his convictions. The report is: “Mr. Smith
said he would agree to put a stop to the importation
of Negroes but he believed it to be impossible. For
this reason he would vote for the bill.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The House
had meantime reported that “the laws prohibiting
the importation of Negroes can be so amended as to
prevent their introduction among us,” but a strong
faction were for action on the Senate bill. “Mr.
Drayton was of the opinion that the committee
should proceed to consider the bill from the Senate
rather than the report of the committee of this
House. He confessed that he was a friend to that
bill in its utmost latitude. Many of the planters
had cash which they could not so well dispose of as
in purchasing Negroes, and he did not see why they
should not be allowed to improve their estates in the
best manner they were able, as well as merchants or
any other class of persons.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The House was not, however, swayed from its
course. It proceeded to consider the report of the
committee, and a bill in accordance therewith was
arranged to be brought before the House on the 12th.
On that date, upon a motion to postpone the second
reading to February 1, 1804, the same was lost by
a vote of 41 to 63; and upon the following day the
bill from the Senate came up, and, by a vote of 55
to 46, became a law.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> With the majority appears
only one great name, Langdon Cheves. With the
minority is recorded the name of a new member,
Joseph Alston, destined to something of a career,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
who on this occasion, in opposition to the bill permitting
importation, made a notable speech.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>From the achievement of her independence in
1783, South Carolina had legislated against the importation
of Negro slaves with greater and greater
severity. The indications are all that this reversal
of her past policy was the result of the matter having
been sprung as a surprise by Governor Richardson
in the second year of his term of office, when the
Senate was two to one in favor of such action as he
suggested, and even in the more popular branch of
the Legislature a majority of nine in one hundred
and one votes could be secured. Under these conditions,
that a strong effort should have been at
once inaugurated by those who opposed the importation,
to repeal the Act permitting same was natural,
and, upon the reassembling of the Legislature
in the fall of 1804, a bill having such for its purpose
was introduced, pressed to a vote in the Senate,
and lost by only one vote, the record being 16 for,
17 against repeal of Act permitting importation, and
two absent.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Four days later the House went into committee
on the following resolution: “Resolved, that in the
opinion of this House, it is inexpedient and impolitic
to permit the importation of slaves into this
State, and that a committee of five be appointed to
bring in a bill for that purpose.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The resolution
was adopted by a vote of 69 to 39, and among the
names of the majority appears that of William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Lowndes. Thus the two Houses being unable to
agree before adjournment, it was to be inferred,
from the heavy majority in the House, against importation
and the extremely narrow margin by
which it had been sustained in the Senate, the fight
would again be made, at the convening of the Legislature,
in the fall of 1805. And so it was, for upon
its reassembling Governor Paul Hamilton at once
and pointedly referred to the subject in his message:
“I should be wanting in my endeavors towards the
public good were I to omit soliciting you to legislate
on the importation of slaves. Abstractedly from
other considerations of it, on which indeed much
may be said, I feel myself bound to represent its
continuance as productive of effects the most injurious,
in draining us of our specie, thereby embarrassing
our commercial men and naturally lessening
the sales of our produce; that viewed with
reference to population it increases our weakness
not our strength; for it must be admitted that in
proportion as you add to the number of slaves, you
prevent the influx of those men who would increase
the means of defence and security. I will add, that
an immediate stop to this traffic is, in my judgment,
on every principle of sound policy, indispensable.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The message at once engaged the attention of the
newly elected House, to the Speakership of which
Joseph Alston had been elected. The young Speaker
was a most interesting personality. His father,
with perhaps one exception, was the largest slave-owner
in the State, and of the latter, we are informed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
that “in his opinion the true interests of the
planter were in exact accord with the dictates of an
enlightened humanity. The consequence was that
his numerous plantations were models of neatness
and order and his slaves always exhibited an appearance
of health and comfort, which spoke well
for their treatment.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>This election to the Speakership was the beginning
of a political career for Joseph Alston, which
soon led to the Governorship and might well have
extended into national fields, had it not been for the
tragedy which cut it short. He had just married
Theodosia Burr, the fascinating and accomplished
daughter of Aaron Burr. But the death of his only
son in 1812 and almost immediately after, the loss
of his wife at sea, seemed literally to destroy all his
interest in life and take it from him. This debate
in 1805, in which he was the foremost figure, is alluded
to in the diary of Edward Hooker, by whom
we are informed that the principle speakers in the
House were Simons, Alston, Miles, Taylor and
Wright. The resolution under consideration, as
drawn up by Joseph Alston, was prefaced with
several considerations, such as the inconsistency of
the slave trade with the precepts of Christianity—with
justice, humanity, etc., and later with the true
interests of the State. In the argument of Mr.
Miles, of Richland, appear the extraordinary insinuations
of Governor Richardson, as to the injustice
of the law with regard to those who found
it difficult to violate it, and whom it did prohibit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
from importing slaves. Of the members of the
House and Senate who sufficiently struck the attention
of Hooker to draw from him something like a
pen portrait, Barnwell, Lowndes and Alston stand
out the clearest. He estimated Alston to be about
twenty-eight years of age. He was not quite
twenty-seven. He describes him thus: “Mr. Alston
is a short man and rather thick. Of a dark complexion,
with thick black hair and a formidable
pair of whiskers, that cover a great part of his face,
and nearly meet at the chin. His dress and demeanor
are well deserving the name buckish. When
not in the legislative hall, he may be seen as often
as anywhere, about the stables, looking at fine
horses, dressed in a short jockey-like surtout or
frock, and laced and tossled boots, with a segar in
his mouth, and much more of the ‘gig and tandem’
levity than the austere virtues of a senatorial leader.
Indeed he is one of the last persons that I should
have picked out from the crowd of people in town
for a president of one branch of the Legislature.”</p>

<p>Of the speech he says: “Alston’s speech appears
to me more like an extemporaneous one, though it is
said by such as are acquainted with him that he
always, without exception, writes his speeches. He
like Simons, used notes, but did not recur to them so
often; nor did he confine himself so much to method,
nor avoid so scrupulously every expression not
stamped with elegance, yet his arrangement was not
bad, nor his language undignified. He did not at
first speak with uncommon fluency, indeed he stammered
a little, but when he became once fairly engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
his words appeared to flow with great ease.
His figures and allusions were eminently striking
and beautiful, and his speech abounded with them.
He dropped some excellent moral and political sentiments,
quoted two or three texts of sublime morality
from the Scriptures, and with great vehemence
and apparent sincerity urged the House to consult
the dictates of justice and humanity, in opposition
to sordid interest. His manner of delivery was extremely
good and his gestures forcible and expressive.
He labored some time, and with success, to
show that the increase of slaves tends to destroy
that equality which is the basis of our republican institutions
and insists that it is not only unjust to
bring them in, but demonstrably injurious to the
real interests of the State. In his argument was a
fund of good sense and useful information. The
utmost silence pervaded the House while he spoke
thirty-five or forty minutes.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The resolution was adopted, and the bill prohibiting
importation was sent to the Senate by a vote of
56 to 28.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Later, by the same pen, we have a brief description
of the last speech upon this bill of that Senator,
who in opposition to it, may be said to have cast the
most important vote he was ever called upon to give.</p>

<p>Allusion has been before made to the brief reason
given by Senator William Smith for his vote, for
opening the ports to importation of slaves, which he
declared himself not in favor of, but thought it impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
to prevent, in 1803, when he, constituting
one of the majority of two to one in that branch of
the General Assembly, voted to open them. Public
opinion had swept away that great majority, and
from the House, with just such a vote, two to one,
the bill to prohibit came to the Senate. The following
is Hooker’s description of the situation, and
the part played by Smith:</p>

<p>“The bill having passed the lower House, the public
feeling is excited about its event here. Mr. Smith,
a lawyer from York District, made a long and rather
tedious speech against it. He is not fluent, nor does
he use the handsomest language, but in the course
of his argument gets out considerable that is to the
purpose.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Smith’s vote was sufficient to kill the bill. It
failed of passage by 15 to 16 in the Senate.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> He
thus, by his vote alone made impossible, what he
claimed to favor, but declined to support, because he
asserted he believed to be impossible. Later in the
United States Senate he disclosed, that in the four
years he thus secured for the slave trade to pour its
flood upon South Carolina, in 202 vessels, 39,075
slaves were brought into the port of Charleston<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
for which he had the effrontery to hold almost
everybody but himself responsible. This disastrous
piece of legislation increased the Negro population
of South Carolina in that decade 41 per cent, against
an increase of only 9 per cent whites, and checked
almost entirely the remarkable increase of whites,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
which had marked the previous decade. As to the
effect upon the business of Charleston, in the reminiscence
of one of the editors of the daily press, we
have an illuminating illustration of the truth of
Senator Barnwell’s prophecy. Says Mr. Thomas:
“In November 1803, I returned from my fourth voyage
with a printed catalogue of fifty thousand volumes
of books in every branch of literature, arts
and sciences, being by far the largest importation
ever made into the United States. I had only got
them opened and arranged for sale three days when
news arrived from Columbia that the Legislature
then in session had opened the port for the importation
of slaves from Africa. The news had not been
five hours in the city before two large British
Guineamen that had been laying off and on the port
for several days, expecting it, came up to town, and
from that day my business began to decline, although
then in a situation to carry it on to three
times the extent I had ever done before. Previous
to this the planters had large sums of money laying
idle in the banks, which they liberally expended not
only for their actual, but supposed wants. A great
change at once took place in everything. Vessels
were fitted out in numbers for the coast of Africa,
and as fast as they returned their cargoes were
bought up with avidity, not only consuming the large
funds which had been accumulating, but all that
could be procured, and finally exhausting credit and
mortgaging the slaves for payment, many of whom
were not redeemed for ten years afterwards to my
knowledge.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand the State of Ohio, which had
been admitted in 1800 with 45,628 whites and only
336 colored, was so disturbed by the growth of its
colored population that before they reached in number
two thousand, that State passed the notorious
Black Laws of January 9, 1805, of which Section 4
reads as follows: “That no black or mulatto person
shall hereafter be permitted to be sworn or give
evidence in any Court of record or elsewhere in the
State in any cause depending or matter of controversy,
where either party to the same is a white
person, or in any prosecution which shall be instituted
in behalf of this State against any white
person.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>While South Carolina did not permit the full
sweep of such in her Courts,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> holding a free person
of color born of a free white woman an admissible
witness yet, with such legislation in Ohio, and Indiana,
it is not surprising, Fiske, of New York, six
years later failed to establish his contention that
“color was a mere matter of accident * * * All men
were born free and equal”; and that his attempt
to reject the Senate amendment to the Orleans bill,
i. e. the insertion of the word “white” before the
words “free male inhabitants,” in defining the electorate,
should have been brushed aside by Sheffey, of
Virginia, with the simple declaration that “such
doctrines would prostrate the civil institutions of
Virginia.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It was one thing to protest as Col.
Mason did against the slave trade; but, with some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
four hundred thousand slaves, double what any
other State possessed, Virginia was prepared to contend
for her property rights, and the position seems
to have been met with acquiescence by Congress.</p>

<p>Concerning free persons of color in the United
States, of whom there were about 210,000, to 1,550,000
Negro slaves, in 1816, it was asserted, in the
petition of the Kentucky Abolition Society to Congress,
which asked that a suitable territory should
be set apart as asylum for emancipated Negroes and
mulattoes, “that when emancipated they were not
allowed the privileges of free citizens and were
prohibited from emigrating to other States and
Territories.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Certainly if their testimony could only be received
in courts of justice in cases, when not in
opposition to the interests of the whites, which was
the situation in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, their
ability to protect themselves against injury from
whites was seriously affected, but, at the same time,
that this tiny stream, trickling into Ohio, was thus
harshly dammed, the Negroes were pouring into
South Carolina in such numbers, that legislation
against their introduction from other States and
Territories was passed.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>But again the same desire for ephemeral benefits
to a class, which had sufficed to overthrow a wise
law in 1803, induced action for repeal in 1818, and,
with lamentable lack of foresight, the brilliant
George McDuffie led the fight for the repeal of the
law of 1816.</p>

<p>By the census of 1810, the colored population of
South Carolina was 200,919, the white only 214,196.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>With the exception of Louisiana, just admitted,
with a colored population of 42,245, and a white
population of 34,311, no State in the Union had,
proportionately to its white, as great a Negro population
as South Carolina. The increase of its colored
population had been so accelerated by the mischievous
action of Governor Richardson and his supporters
in 1803, as to have increased almost two
and a half times as much as that of Maryland, the
Negro population of which, as has been before
pointed out, was greater than that of South Carolina
in 1790, and had increased from that day to
1800 in a greater proportion compared to its white
population, than South Carolina.</p>

<p>It is true the increase of the colored population
of North Carolina had also been very great; but, at
the same time, the increase of the white population
had been much greater than in South Carolina, and
it had had originally so much larger a number of
white inhabitants that they were still more than
double the number of blacks.</p>

<p>To a large and important portion of South Carolina’s
legislators, therefore, the evil of this continual
increase of the Negro population was apparent,
and these under the leadership of Robert Y.
Hayne, at that time Speaker of the House, opposed
the repeal of the law of 1816.</p>

<p>Unfortunately no Hooker was present to record
his impressions of the discussion, and all that we
know of this great struggle is, that the Act of 1816
was repealed after “one of the most eloquent and
animated debates that has taken place on the floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
for many years.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In the Senate the repeal was
only secured by a vote of 22 to 19.</p>

<p>In the year which followed came in Congress the
first great sectional struggle over the Missouri
Question, involving the right of Southern men to
move into the Northwest with their slaves, with
regard to which some of them argued, that, in the
long run, such diffusion of slaves would not increase
their number or result in the extension of
slavery, but rather tend to check the increase.</p>

<p>In his contemporaneous publication of speeches
from both sides, the editor of Niles’ Register regrets
his inability to secure a copy of the speech of William
Lowndes, which, in all probability would have
been the most illuminating exposition of the Southern
view, which could have been submitted; but the
speech of Tucker, of Virginia, does put forward the
idea as about stated; while Sergeant, of Pennsylvania,
the leading speaker on the Northern side,
combats the same at sufficient length to create the
impression, that it was held by more than one. But
what is of greater interest is the distinct note of
racial inferiority, which Sergeant sounds loudly.
It is not only objection to the Negro slave; but to
the Negro <em>per se</em>; ... “Nature has placed upon
them an unalterable mark ... They are and must
forever remain distinct.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Senator Smith, who, by his vote in the South Carolina
Legislature in 1805 had most materially assisted
in setting aside the South Carolina law in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
opposition to African importation, while at the
same time fatuously declaring that he only did so
because he thought it impossible to prevent it, now,
in the United States Senate, refused all compromise,
declaring that by sanctioning the slave trade in the
Constitution, the Federal Government was responsible
for existing conditions. But a compromise
was effected, and in the year 1820, the Union, then
consisting of just double the number of the original
thirteen States, adjusted the difference on the Negro
Question.</p>

<p>Geographically considered it was apparent that
the black belt had slipped a little lower down upon
the body politic. The total colored population of the
Union was 1,771,856, more than half of whom were
to be found in the three States of Virginia, North
Carolina and South Carolina. In Virginia, 402,031;
in South Carolina, 265,301; in North Carolina,
219,629; a total of 886,961. Southwest of this section
and south of the Ohio River, the Negro population
amounted to 529,856; but in no State in the
Union had the increase since 1800 been so enormous
as in South Carolina; for with an area and white
population only two-fifths of Virginia, the increase
of the Negro population of the two States had practically
been the same, viz.: 156,538 for Virginia,
156,457 for South Carolina. Nor could any comforting
reassurance have been drawn from the fact
that the percentage of increase of the same species
of population in the States of Georgia, Tennessee
and Kentucky had been greater; for such had been
accompanied, in these newer States, with an even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
greater increase of their white population, and was
based upon an original Negro population very small
indeed, when compared to that of South Carolina
in 1800. When comparison was made with Maryland,
on the other hand, where the number of Negroes
had originally been greater than in South
Carolina, with the increase of the whites in the three
decades not so great, small as had been the increase
of the whites, it was yet greater than that of the
colored, and originally the proportion of whites had
been greater.</p>

<p>From all these causes South Carolina was becoming
in place of Virginia the State most identified
with the Negro question, in a section where it was
becoming a larger and more important property interest.</p>

<p>Yet, while the increase of the Negro population
in the lower South and Middle and Southwest had
been very great, the census furnished no evidence
of that movement of Negroes from North to South
which has been so often alluded to. The Negro
population of New York had increased by more than
50 per cent; New Jersey by at least 43; Connecticut,
40; and Delaware 38. Pennsylvania’s increase in
the 30 years had been 200 per cent, and even in Massachusetts
the increase had been 22 per cent. The
only State in which there had been a decrease, which
could be attributed to a movement to another section,
was Rhode Island, and it was not large enough
to be considered, amounting in all to less than a
thousand. Considering the population of the Southern
States, however, the census afforded information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
well warranting the assumption that from Virginia
and Maryland between the years 1810 and
1820 some 30,000 colored people had moved out.
In the same time the colored population of North
Carolina had increased by an accession of about
40,000; South Carolina, 65,000; Georgia, 44,000;
Alabama, 24,000; Mississippi, 16,000; Louisiana,
35,000; Tennessee, 37,000; and Missouri, 7,000;
the percentage of increase being, North Carolina
24 per cent; South Carolina 32 per cent; Georgia 42
per cent; Mississippi 95 per cent; Louisiana 55 per
cent; Tennessee 80 per cent; Kentucky 58 per cent;
and Missouri nearly 300 per cent, with no basis with
which to estimate the 42,000 of Alabama.</p>

<p>These figures establish a movement from Virginia
and Maryland but also from without, to the eight
States of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee and
Kentucky, averaging about 45 per cent increase in
the decade, and with every reasonable allowance for
the movement from Virginia and Maryland and
New York, of which at least one-third must have
gone to the Northwest and Missouri, illegal importation
must have been proceeding apace. Now, if
there was illegal importation, where would it be
most likely to occur?</p>

<p>In Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee; and
there we find an increase of nearly 85 per cent, or an
addition to the Negro population of something like
88,000.</p>

<p>These facts, therefore, disclose the weakness of the
Southern argument that the diffusion of slaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
would not have resulted in any extension of slavery.
Theoretically it was a sound argument, that the
slaves being spread over the face of the country,
they and their masters would be brought more and
more under the influences which would work against
slavery and for emancipation. But if illicit importation
from abroad was proceeding to any great
extent, the premise upon which the argument was
based gave way, and this is what must have been
the case, as has been shown.</p>

<p>This is also where the argument of Prof. Ulrich
Bonnell Phillips fails to convince, when he expresses
the opinion, that “the importance of the repeal, in
1818, of the law which had prohibited the importation
of slaves from other States into South Carolina
has been exaggerated.” He bases his reason
for this view upon the claim that “the Federal Censuses
show that the average rate of increase of the
Negro population in South Carolina between 1810
and 1860, was substantially smaller than that of
the Negroes in the United States at large, “which”
he thinks, “indicates that South Carolina was in that
half century more of a slave exporting than a slave
importing State; and that a prohibition of slave imports
would have had no appreciable influence upon
the ratio of increase of her Negro population.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Unless it can be shown, however, that there were
no accessions to the Negro population of the United
States from without, between the periods selected by
Prof. Phillips, the mere fact that the rate of increase
of the Negro population of South Carolina was substantially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
smaller than that of the United States at
large does not establish that South Carolina was
more of a slave exporting than importing State for
that period; for the greater increase without could
well be due to importation in great volume elsewhere,
and that there was such was asserted by
many, notably by Henry Middleton, in Congress, the
very year of Hayne’s speech in the South Carolina
Legislature against importations from other States.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
But apart from this, before this, South Carolina had
become the State with the largest Negro population
to its white population of all the States of the Union
and that, the rate of increase of her Negro population
from this date, or even a decade earlier, to 1860,
“was substantially smaller than that of the Negroes
in the United States at large” was simply due to
the tremendous accessions of the Negro population
of the four new cotton States: Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana, superimposed upon a
Negro population originally much smaller than that
of South Carolina. The Negro population of those
four States did in that period increase 1,384,555;
but in the same time their white population increased
1,438,607; while in the same period the white and
Negro population of South Carolina increased respectively
53,860 and 147,028. And so difficult was
it to overcome this tremendous start attained by
South Carolina in these early fatal years, that in
1860 the excess of South Carolina’s colored population
over her white population was 121,029, as compared
with an excess of only 83,505 for Mississippi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the next greatest. Undoubtedly in the period
selected by Prof. Phillips many Negro slaves passed
out of South Carolina; but many whites did also;
for “from 1820 to 1860, South Carolina was a beehive
from which swarms were continually going
forth to populate the newer growing cotton States
of the Southwest,” and “in 1860 there were then living
in other States 193,389 white persons born in
South Carolina.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In the half century the average
rate of increase of South Carolina whites was
between 7 and 8 per cent, colored 21. In Virginia
and Maryland in 1810 the Negro population
amounted to 668,515. It increased by 1860 by an
addition of 151,523. In South Carolina in 1810 the
Negro population amounted to 200,919, by 1860 it
had received an addition of 212,401, of which 64,382
had arrived in the decade of the repeal of the law
prohibiting importation from other States, and 58,021
in the following decade. It is true that in the
following decade from 1830 to 1840, the increase of
the Negro population of South Carolina was comparatively
slight, being only 11,992, but it was followed
in the next decade by again an increase of
58,630, while the white increase in the same two
decades was respectively 2,221 and 15,479.</p>

<p>But there was another way of measuring the importance
of the repeal. Necessarily with the inflowing
tide came some such as Denmark Vesey and
Gullah Jack, slaves and free Negroes whose past was
not known, and according to the report of the Massachusetts
legislative committee in 1821, dealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
with only 6,740 free persons of color in the State,
among other “evils,” from such, appeared, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter
alia</i>:</p>

<p>2. Collecting in the large towns an indolent and
disorderly and corrupt population.</p>

<p>3. Substituting themselves in many labors and
occupations which in the end it would be more advantageous
to have performed by the white and
native population of the State.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>It is apparent then, from this, as well as from
the arguments of Mr. Sergeant, that the real situation
of the representatives of the two sections, in
the great Missouri debate, has never been put with
absolute accuracy. It was an assertion upon the
part of the Southerners of their right to carry their
property with them wherever they went in the
Union, and upon the part of the Northerners a
denial of this right. It precipitated an argument
whether extension and diffusion of slavery meant
the same thing, many Southern men, of eminence,
contended that by the process of diffusion there
would be apt to be the beginning of the end of
slavery, and if there had been no illicit importation
of slaves possible, there would have been great
merit in this suggestion. But beyond all these arguments
on the part of the Northerners, the Missouri
Question indicated opposition to the mere presence
of the Negro, bond or free, in the Northwest.
He was an undesirable resident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Up to this time, in the main, the attitude of the
Southern statesmen had been free from sectionalism.
On the other hand, New England had exhibited
sectionalism, and it was New England’s deputies
in the Constitutional Convention, who joining with
those of Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina
and Georgia, had “formed a bargain,” abrogating
the slave trade in such a way as practically to recognize
slavery as a property interest secured by the
Constitution. The time allowed the slave trade had
been long enough, as Madison had said it would be.
As great as had been the rate of increase of the
white population, it had been exceeded by that of
the colored in the proportions of 90 to 95 per cent.
What Col. Mason had prophesied had also come to
pass. He had declared in 1787: “The Western people
are already calling out for slaves for their new
lands and will fill that country with slaves, if they
can be got through South Carolina and Georgia.”</p>

<p>They had been got no doubt in large numbers
through South Carolina and Georgia; but also, in
all probabilities, through Louisiana, and if not
through, to some extent from, Maryland and Virginia.
The Negro population had in the West, in
three decades sprung up from 16,322 to 385,825;
while the seven States, Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and
Louisiana, held some 1,193,732 head of this species
of property, representing an investment of something
like $477,492,800, stamped as property by
having been made dutiable under Federal law up to
1808. Such a property interest was almost certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
to produce a sectional policy for its protection, and
in the assertion of such a policy, South Carolina
having the largest stake and the most forceful representatives,
would naturally take the lead.</p>

<p>The consequences were that the broad national
policy of Lowndes, from this date gradually succumbed
to the influences which forced Calhoun away
from it, despite his efforts to mould into one form a
national and sectional policy, based upon the declared
recognition of slavery, in place of, or in addition
to, the implied recognition furnished by the
Constitutional compromise or “bargain” over the
sanction of the slave trade up to 1808. As the
South drew together in support of slavery, the overshadowing
dimensions of its greatest exponent cast
into oblivion Barnwell, Hamilton and Alston, who
had so clearly perceived the dangers from its increase,
and even reduced the proportions of men as
preëminently great as Lowndes and his successor,
Robert Y. Hayne.</p>

<p>As long as the tariff held the center of the stage,
the change was not so clearly apparent; but with
the settling down, after the explosion of sentiment
which nullification occasioned, the division between
the sections was unmistakable. From that period
the Lower South presented an unbroken front in
defence of slavery, under the leadership of South
Carolina.</p>

<p>From 1800 the South had, to a great extent, directed
the policies of the Republic, and, in the persons
of Lowndes, Cheves and Calhoun, South Carolina
had from 1813 to 1820 been a potent influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
therein; but the Missouri Compromise and Taylor’s
election over Lowndes in 1820, for the Speakership,
marked the beginning of the change. No man
saw it more clearly than the great man whom Taylor
defeated. His views on the condition of affairs
at this time is thus expressed by a contemporary:
“The Northern people had outstripped the Southern
and desired to see the offices of the Government
in Northern hands. This inevitable result Mr.
Lowndes saw clearly forty years ago, and thought
it wise for the South to yield the hold she had so
long possessed on political power, when she was no
longer able to retain it.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The clear judgment of
Lowndes had revealed to him what the fatal brilliancy
of Calhoun’s intellect prevented him from
perceiving, viz.: that there could not be fashioned
for the needs of imperfect humanity a perfectly
symmetrical policy. Lowndes had brought Webster
and Clay together and pushed through the tariff
bill of 1816.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Of that bill in reply to the fierce criticism that it
was the worst thing done since universal suffrage,
he simply said, “neither was altogether good, but
the best possible for the time.” “He thought some
protection due to infant industries and that the
question was, what measure of protection do they
require?” He held; “We are obliged to leave some
questions to posterity. We do our best with those
that come to us and future generations must bear
their share of the trouble.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Accordingly, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the Baldwin bill of 1820 was brought forward, “he
opposed it on the ground that the increased duties
were not necessary.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Before the tariff bill of
1824 could be presented, he had passed away; but
in his place, to share with Webster, the honors of
the splendid fight against it, South Carolina had
sent up to Congress Robert Y. Hayne, by Benton
extolled as: “Of all the young generation of statesmen
coming on I consider him the safest, the most
like William Lowndes, and best entitled to future
eminent lead.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>How well Hayne lived up to this a study of his
achievements exhibits. But while so good a judge
as the late Edward M. Shepard, in his Life of Van
Buren, ranks Hayne’s effort in the Senate, against
the tariff of 1824, as fully up to, if not beyond, that
of Webster in the House, scarcely any attention is
paid to it by those historians who extoll the speech
of Webster.</p>

<p>Again, while almost every history deals at length
with the Senatorial debates, and elaborates Hayne’s
speech on the Panama Mission in 1825, absolutely
no mention appears concerning the far more important
utterance with regard to the Colonization Society
in 1827. Yet Hayne’s speech, in his debate
with Chambers over the Colonization Society, is one
of the most important utterances ever made by a
Southern Statesman. It indicates what was the
prevailing view with regard to the Negro Question,
before the unfortunate episode of nullification, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
which Calhoun fastened upon the South the belief
that slavery as it existed in the Southern States, was
a good. In the speech in 1827, Hayne first showed
the absurdity of the scheme of transporting the
blacks to Africa in such a number as to affect the
situation. That the presence of Negroes in the
country was an evil, he did not attempt to deny,
but declared, “The progress of time and events is
providing a remedy for the evil.” He showed by
statistics that the relative increase of free white
population was rising, while that of the colored,
whether bond or free, was diminishing, and that
“while this process is going on the colored classes
are gradually diffusing themselves throughout the
country, and are making steady advances in intelligence
and refinement, and if half the zeal were
displayed in bettering their condition that is wasted
in the vain and fruitless effort of sending them
abroad, their intellectual and moral improvement
would be steady and rapid.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Why is it that this
utterance of the leader of his party in the Senate
is never alluded to by historians? Is it because it
invites investigation as to the condition of the
blacks in the Northern and Western States at this
period and for the twenty years which followed?
It is difficult to tell. But from this time the question
took a change. Subordinating to it the tariff
and the interest in railroad development, with the
conditions created by nullification by 1833, the State
of South Carolina, and, by 1839, the South, was committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
to the view of Calhoun: “Our fate as a people
is bound up in the question. If we yield, we will
be extirpated; but if we successfully resist, we will
be the greatest and most flourishing people of modern
time. It is the best substratum of population
in the world, and one on which great and flourishing
Commonwealths may be most easily and safely
reared.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> And to this “Negro substratum population”
policy both the tariff and the railroad development
of the South were accordingly subordinated until
Calhoun’s death, when Georgia, as a result of
having outstripped South Carolina in both men and
material, stepped into the place of leadership South
Carolina could no longer fill, and with the ambitious
scheme of forcing slavery to the Pacific, in ten
years, produced the War Between the States.</p>

</div>


<p>As has been shown, nine years subsequent to his
unavailing struggle to restrict the swelling proportions
of the Negro population in his own State,
Robert Y. Hayne, in the United States Senate, stated
his views concerning that class of our population
with regard to the entire country. But before discussing
that further it should be noted, that a renewed
effort in 1822 had again been defeated by the
narrow but effective majority of nine votes, drawing
from Governor Bennett, of South Carolina the
pessimistic declaration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The evil is entailed and we can do no more than steadily
to pursue that course indicated by stern necessity and not
less imperious policy.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Along another line, therefore, was the last peaceful
effort to be made to solve the Negro Question.
Taken in connection with the great industrial work,
in which he literally wore out his life, in 1839,
Hayne’s speech in the United States Senate in 1827
is most illuminating. Upon that occasion he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The history of this country has proved that when the
relative proportion of the colored population to the white
is greatly diminished, slaves cease to be valuable, and emancipation
follows of course, and they are swallowed up in the
common mass. Wherever free labor is put in full and successful
operation, slave labor ceases to be profitable. It
is true that it is a very gradual operation and that it must
be, to be successful or desirable.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Was it not the very irony of fate that, as this
speaker, later, in 1839, lay dying at Asheville, North
Carolina, while a wordy war was being waged over
his great railroad to the West, criticism should
have been “directed against the contracts given to
planters to be executed with slave labor” by the chief
lieutenant of that great South Carolinian, who had
only the year before, in withdrawing from the enterprise,
extolled Negro slaves as “the best substratum
of population in the world?”</p>

<p>Col. Gadsden, from this time and on, more and
more a confidant of Calhoun until they parted over
Taylor’s candidacy for the Presidency, asked:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Why had not the work been given to Northern contractors,
who had offered to execute it at a price 12½ to 15
per cent cheaper? The answer was comprehensive. The
planters objected to imported free labor being brought into
contact with their slaves. This was unfortunate, but the
company could not antagonize an element which practically
controlled the State; and in addition they had in many instances
given the right of way. But further still, when the
chief engineer obtained the floor, he challenged the correctness
of the charge.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Between 1830 and 1840, two Southern States,
South Carolina and Maryland, leading the Union in
railroad development, were endeavoring to effect
railroad connection with the Northwest. A comparison
of their conditions prior and subsequent to
1810, suggests one of the reasons why one succeeded
and the other failed.</p>

<p>From 1790 to 1810 the white population of Maryland
increased from 208,649 to 235,117, or about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
11.10 per cent. In the same twenty years the white
population of South Carolina rose from 140,178 to
214,196 or about 51.20 per cent. It is quite true that
in the same period the Negro population in South
Carolina increased from 108,805 to 200,919 or 85.6
per cent, while that of Maryland rose only from
111,079 to 145,129 or only 30.07 per cent. Yet, when
we bear in mind that the area of South Carolina
was two and a half times as great as Maryland,
had the efforts which had been made in 1816 and in
1822 to stop Negro importation from outside succeeded,
the economic conditions of South Carolina
between 1830 and 1840 might have been stronger.
Indeed in 1822 Gen. Thomas Pinckney declared
cheap Negro labor, even then, was steadily undermining
the white artisan class in South Carolina.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
He was patriot enough to so declare, although his
own great brother was more responsible than any
one else for the evil.</p>

<p>In the three decades which followed 1810, and
closed with the death of Hayne and the destruction
of his five year effort to secure the Northwestern
railroad connection, the colored population of Maryland,
which did secure it, increased only 6,396, from
145,429 to 151,815, while its white population in the
same period rose from 235,117 to 318,204, an increase
of 83,087. In South Carolina in the same
time the white population rising from 214,196 to
259,344 increased only 44,883, about one-half as
much, while its Negro population rising from 200,314
to 335,344, or 134,395, about twenty times as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
as Maryland. Viewed in the light of the unfair
criticism directed against the South Carolina Railroad,
was not the message of Governor Paul Hamilton
in 1804, to the South Carolina Legislature, vindicated?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Viewed with reference to population it increases our
weakness, not our strength, for it must be admitted that
in proportion as you add to the number of slaves, you prevent
the influx of those men who would increase the means
of defense and security.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>
</div>

<p>How our forgotten great men fought to avoid the
Nessus Shirt! Who remembers that Hamilton was
big enough to be made Secretary of the Navy? Under
the great upas tree of South Carolina all other
greatness languished and by 1840 the property interests
in Negroes had become so immense, that it
not only paralyzed other industries, which could by
any stretch of imagination be thought to threaten
its efficiency, but it affected public opinion to a degree
which now seems hardly credible.</p>

<p>Calhoun’s view in 1838, that the Negro furnished
“the best substratum of population in the world
and the one on which commonwealths may be most
easily and safely reared”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> was not singular in the
South at that date. The great meeting of Southern
business men at Augusta, Ga. in 1838 put on
record its belief:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That of all the social conditions of man, the most favorable
to the development of the cardinal virtues of the heart
and the noblest faculties of the soul, to the promotion of private<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
happiness and public prosperity, is that of slave holding
communities under free political institutions.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Even Hayne, himself, despite his realization of
South Carolina’s wasteful cultivation of her soil, was
so affected by the tremendous interests involved in
slavery, and the fearful shock of any such disturbance
as the Abolitionists threatened in 1835, as to
declare at that time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Slavery, as it now exists in the Southern States, which
we all feel and know to be essential to the prosperity and
welfare—nay to the very existence of the States—is so little
understood in other portions of the Union that it has
been lately assailed in a spirit which threatens, unless
speedily arrested, to lead eventually to the destruction of
the Union and all the evils which must attend so lamentable
an occurrence.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
</div>

<p>By 1838, conditions had reached such a development
that the abolition of slavery could come but in
one of two ways, either peacefully, through the slow
process of changing industrial conditions, or swiftly
and forcibly, as a war measure; therefore, when
Calhoun withdrew his support from Hayne’s railroad
to the Northwest in 1838, the sensible course
would have been to prepare for the inevitable conflict.</p>

<p>Allusion has been made to the Black Laws of Ohio,
which had their counterpart in Indiana and Illinois,
and reference had to the Report of the Massachusetts
Legislative Committee in 1821, as indicative of
feeling in the North and Northeast, concerning the
Negro as a citizen, and, if we consider conditions in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
the Middle States at this period, we will find them
hardly different. As depicted by the most highly
educated member of the Negro race today in the
United States, in Philadelphia conditions were as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By 1830 the black population of the city and districts
had increased to 15,624, an increase of 27 per cent for the
decade 1820-1830, and of 48 per cent since 1810. Nevertheless
the growth of the city had far outstripped this; by 1830
the county had nearly 175,000 whites, among whom was a
rapidly increasing contingent of 5,000 foreigners. So intense
was the race antipathy among the lower classes, and
so much countenance did it receive from the middle and upper
classes, that there began in 1829 a series of riots directed
chiefly against Negroes, which recurred frequently until
about 1840, and did not wholly cease until after the war.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>
</div>

<p>At this date, 1840, in ten of the eleven States
which later constituted the Confederacy, there were
3,311,117 whites and 2,267,319 Negroes; and in three
of them; South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana,
the whites were in the minority, and they, therefore,
best represented the condition which Calhoun in
1838 extolled.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>With such views, what more natural than that
Calhoun should view as a “humbug” the great railroad
measure of Hayne, founded as it was in some
degree upon the belief of the latter that “wherever
free labor is put in full and successful operation,
slave labor ceases to be profitable.” A railroad connecting
Cincinnati with Charleston would certainly
have tended to “put in full and successful operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
free labor,” and slave labor ceasing more and more
to be profitable would have gradually passed out of
existence in that region.</p>

<p>Yet it must be admitted, that the greatest writer
and thinker who has ever discussed America, viewing
conditions at that time, while utterly opposed
to slavery, practically endorsed Calhoun’s views.
Summing up his conclusion in 1838, de Tocqueville
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When I contemplate the condition of the South, I can
only discover two alternatives which may be adopted by
the white inhabitants of those States; either to emancipate
the Negroes and to intermingle with them; or remain isolated
from them to keep them in a state of slavery as long as
possible. All intermediate measures seem to me likely to
terminate, and that shortly, in the most horrible of civil
wars, and perhaps in the extirpation of one or the other
of the two races.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Time, however, has proven that both de Tocqueville
and Calhoun were wrong.</p>

<p>From a Negro minority of 13,277 in 1810, the
census indicated for South Carolina in 1840, a Negro
majority of 76,230 an excess of the Negro population
over the white of more than double what existed
in Louisiana and quadruple that of Mississippi.</p>

<p>In 1843, for the better controlling of this “best
substratum of population in the world”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> only five
years after its discovery as such, the following Act
was passed by the General Assembly of South Carolina:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
now met and sitting, and by the authority of the same:
That from and after the passage of this Act, any slave or
free person of color who shall commit an assault and battery
on a white woman with intent to commit rape, on being
thereof convicted, shall suffer death without benefit of
clergy.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
</div>

<p>For whites, it was not apparently necessary to
raise the grade of the offense from that of a misdemeanor.
But if the above Act was not a sufficient
vindication of the opposition of Barnwell, Paul Hamilton,
Alston and Hayne to the continued increase of
the Negro population of South Carolina, Calhoun,
himself, furnished something of an argument
against the “best substratum” by his declaration
only nine years after its discovery:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We know what we are about, we foresee what is coming,
and move with no other purpose but to protect our portion
of the Union from the greatest of calamities—not insurrection
but something worse. I see the end if the process is to
go on unresisted; it is to expel in time the white population
of the Southern States and leave the blacks in possession.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If this is a true picture of conditions in 1847, as
black as we may consider the Abolitionists of that
day, one thing is evident, and that is, that without
such a mass of “the best substratum of population”
to work upon, the Abolitionists could not possibly
have effected what Calhoun feared: therefore, the
statesmanship of William Smith, McDuffie, and Calhoun,
which had favored and assisted in the gathering
of it, to that extent was inferior to the statesmanship
of Paul Hamilton, Barnwell, Alston and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Hayne which had attempted to arrest the growth.
But that was not apparent to the South in 1850, and
it is doubtful whether it would be very generally admitted
even today; for interest will color opinion
and Negro cheap labor is still the first consideration
to many people in the South, just as European pauper
labor is to many in the North. Both North and
South can see clearly the mote in their brother’s
eye; but not the beam in their own eye.</p>

<p>By the census of 1850, the population of the 33
States, which constituted the Union, summed up
22,969,603 persons, divided as follows: In the 19
Free States 13,230,231 whites; 213,346 free persons
of color; 2,536 slaves. In the 14 Slave States there
were: 6,113,068 whites; 210,085 free persons of
color; 3,200,590 slaves. That meant that the South
had invested in that species of property interest
$1,280,200,000. By money values and population,
at that time, that was an immense sum.</p>

<p>The Democratic Review, in this same year, published
an article which was republished in the
Charleston <cite>Mercury</cite>, and commended by that paper.
This article sets forth certain distinct claims of considerable
interest:</p>

<p>First that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The face of affairs is entirely changed since General
Pinckney, in convention assented to the proposition giving
Congress the right to pass laws, regulating commerce by a
simple majority, on the ground that it was a boon granted
the North in consideration of the necessity which the weak
South had for the strong North as a neighbor. The cotton
trade then scarcely existed, but the material has since been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
spun into a web which binds the commercial world to Southern
interests.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Figures were also introduced to show that the
multiplication of free blacks in the Slave States was
increasing upon the proportion of slaves and that it
was observable that they did not emigrate from the
Slave States, where it was claimed they must in
time supplant the slaves as servants; and the laws
of Ohio were pointed to as indicating an opposition,
not to slavery, but to the presence of the Negro,
which it claimed, had greatly retarded emancipation.
In these claims truth was mingled with error.</p>

<p>As to the indisposition of the people of Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, to
admit any class of colored persons to enter as residents,
there can be no doubt up to this date, although
indications of a change of sentiment were appearing.
The repeal of the Black Laws of Ohio was one
illustration. With 1,955,059 whites to only 25,279
colored persons, the harsh provisions, which closed
the mouths of these unfortunates when contending
with the whites, in so called courts of justice, it was
conceded by the whites of Ohio, could be safely done
away with, and they had been repealed in 1848.
It may also have been true that the free blacks did
not emigrate from the Slave States; but that in that
region they were gaining upon the slaves, and that
there was any reasonable possibility of their supplanting
them as servants, does hot seem to be borne
out by examination of the census.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>The Democratic Review claims that, while in 1800
there were in the Slave States 61,441 free persons
of color to 73,100 in the Free States, that by 1830
the proportions were 182,070 in the Slave States to
137,525 in the Free States, a proportion raised by
1840 to 215,568 to 172,509. But this seems inexact.
By the census of 1800 there were in the Slave States
52,188 free persons of color, to 55,464 in the Free
States, and by 1830 the number in the Slave States
had, it is true, surpassed the number in the Free
States, such being respectively 160,063 to 153,384.
But whether it was in consequence of the Nat Turner
insurrection of 1831, or the Abolition ebullition of
1835, by 1840 there was a change in progress, the
proportion being in that year 190,285 in the Slave
States to 187,647 in the Free States, which, as has
before been shown, by 1850 had changed to 210,085
in the Slave States to 213,346 in the Free States.</p>

<p>At the same time it could be noted that while the
Negroes in the United States had increased by
more than 28 per cent since 1840, the freedmen had
increased by less than 13 per cent in the same time.</p>

<p>In the Free States of New York, New Hampshire,
Vermont and Connecticut the free colored population
had decreased by 1,402. In the Slave States
of Louisiana and Mississippi it had decreased by
8,174, and that State in the South which held more
than one-fourth of the whole number in the Southern
States, Virginia, had appropriated $30,000 a year
for their removal.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>The South was apparently, therefore, committed
to the institution of African Slavery, and in defense
of it some of its champions were wild enough to
waive the question of the inferiority of the Negro
race and contend, “that slavery, whether of black
or white, is a normal, proper institution in society.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The Richmond, Va., <cite>Inquirer</cite>, The Muscogee, Ala.,
<cite>Herald</cite>, The New Orleans, La., <cite>Delta</cite> and the
Charleston, S. C., <cite>Standard</cite>, are all quoted by an
English writer, whose work appeared in print
about 1855.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The three first as sustaining the
above extraordinary claim; while the fourth called
for a revival of the Slave Trade.</p>

<p>Even if correctly quoted the comments of these
papers do not establish the prevailing sentiment in
the South at that time; for the publication at
Charleston and reception of Dr. John Bachman’s
work on the “Unity of the Human Race” would to
some extent constitute an opinion to the contrary.</p>

<p>But that the South was positively, unreservedly,
and even aggressively committed to the institution
of African Slavery is indisputable.</p>

<p>It had not been so always. The change began in
1833, when the Charleston <cite>Mercury</cite> declared—“The
institution of slavery is not an evil but a benefit.”
That paper had upon that occasion admitted that
in the past the South had entertained a view to the
contrary; but asserted in 1833, that even in Virginia
and North Carolina:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“The great mass of the South sanction no such
admission, that Southern Slavery is an evil to be
deprecated.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>And, as the appetite grows by what it feeds upon,
in 1855, The Richmond <cite>Examiner</cite> was quoted as
declaring:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is all a hallucination that we are ever going to get
rid of African Slavery, or that it will ever be desirable to
do so.... True philanthropy to the Negro begins at
home; and if every Southern man would act as if the canopy
of Heaven were inscribed with a covenant in letters of fire,
that the Negro is here and here forever; is our property
and ours forever; is never to be emancipated; is to be kept
hard at work and in rigid subjection all his days; and is
never to go to Africa, to Polynesia, or to Yankee land,—far
worse than either,—they would accomplish more good for
the race in five years than they boast the institution itself
to have accomplished in two centuries.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Yet as extreme as the above is, it is quite probable
that the extravagance and injustice of the declaration
against slavery in the Southern States, had exasperated
those supporting it to utterances as extravagant.</p>

<p>In the opening of the year 1850 a resolution of the
Legislature of Vermont was introduced in Congress
which recited:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That slavery is a crime against humanity, and a sore
evil in the body politic, that was excused by the framers
of the Federal Constitution as a crime entailed upon the
country by their predecessors, and tolerated solely as a
thing of inexorable necessity.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>How Southern men must have felt this it is almost
impossible for us to appreciate today. It was not
only an indictment of the South at a bar where there
was no provision for a trial; but it ended in a hypocritical
falsehood; for slavery had not been, “tolerated
solely as a thing of inexorable necessity.”
Existing in every State except Massachusetts, the
question whether the existing condition could be
affected by permission to increase the slaves for a
period by importation was committed with the
clauses relating to taxes on exports and to a Navigation
Act, that these things might “form a bargain
between the Northern and Southern States.”</p>

<p>This motion by Gouverneur Morris, of Pennsylvania,
was adopted by the vote of seven of the eleven
States in Convention, against three opposing and
one abstaining from voting, one of the delegates
whereof seconded the motion of Pinckney to increase
the period permitting importation, which he with one
of the opponents of commitment voted for; so that
actually slavery, with the right to increase it by the
Slave Trade, was voted for by nine out of eleven
States participating.</p>

<p>The Vermont resolution accomplished nothing;
but to no individual in Congress could it have inflicted
such a wound as it dealt to Calhoun. To him
resolutions were of enormous importance, and yet
he never seemed quite ready to follow them up
with acts. He was at last in the grasp of that
power which overcomes all things except God.
Twelve years had elapsed since he had been called
upon to decide between the policy of Hayne, based<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
upon the effort to bind together in close commercial
intercourse the leading Western and Southern States,
by a railroad from Ohio to South Carolina, and the
resolution of Rhett, to amend the Constitution or
dissolve the Union.</p>

<p>To neither could he agree. For Hayne’s connection
with Ohio through North Carolina, he substituted
a connection with Arkansas through Georgia.</p>

<p>To the warning of his closest intimate that it was
“better to part peaceably than to live in the state
of indecision we do,” he could only reply with the
vague allusion to:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The many bleeding pores which must be taken up in
passing the knife through a body politic, in order to make
two of one, which had been so long bound together by so
many ties, political, social and commercial.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In this declaration there is unmistakably intense
feeling for the Union; but also some indecision; for
what could have been a more practical application
of Calhoun’s teaching than Rhett’s amendment to
Slade’s bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia?
That was a resolution upon which some
strong action could be erected. Twelve years had
passed, nothing had been done, and now came the
resolution of the Vermont Legislature. In the first
shock which it gave him, Calhoun was unjust to his
own following. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. President, I intended not to say a word on this subject.
I have long labored faithfully to repress the encroachments
of the North, at the commencement I saw where
it would end and must end; and I despair of ever seeing it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
ended in Congress. It will go to its end, for gentlemen
have already yielded to the current of the North which they
admit they cannot resist, Sir, what the South will do is not
for me to say. They will meet it, in my opinion, as it ought
to be met.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>
</div>

<p>A month later he reviewed the political situation
in a most elaborate and searching analysis, his last
great speech, read for him by Senator Mason, of
Virginia. “How Can the Union be Preserved?” In
endeavoring to give an “answer to this great question,”
he asserted that the discontent of the South
was due to the fact that political power had been
taken from that section and transferred to the
North, not through natural causes, but by legislation
which could be classed under three heads, the
first of which was exclusion from common territory;
second a system of revenue under which an undue
portion of the burden of taxation had been imposed
upon the South, and the proceeds appropriated to
the North; third a system of measures changing
the original character of the government. The result,
he claimed, had been a change from a Constitutional
Federal Republic to the despotism of a
numerical majority in which a question of vital
importance to the minority was threatened:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The relation between the races in the Southern section
... which cannot be destroyed without subjecting the two
races to the greatest calamity, and the section to poverty,
desolation and wretchedness.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Whether right or wrong, the first of these claims
had been settled by the Missouri Compromise in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
1820, which the South had acquiesced in. The
second Calhoun, himself, had undertaken to right
in 1832, and if there had been a failure it was due
in some measure to his inability to diagnose with
sufficient accuracy the situation at that time.</p>

<p>Along two lines from 1827 there had proceeded the
effort of the South to recover her power and increase
her population; to restore her waning political
influence and rebuild her commercial strength.
One was through revision of the tariff, the other
through internal improvement by means of railroad
development. The first, despite all the interest it
attracted and the splendid forensic display it gave
rise to, not only was a lamentable failure in its
curative effect, but very probably added somewhat
to the difficulties which hampered the other. Now
with regard to the first, Calhoun had mapped out the
plan, and undertook the responsibility through the
nullification project, with which he effected the
relegation of Hayne to the post of Governor of the
State of South Carolina from the United States
Senate, to which he, himself, repaired with almost
ambassadorial powers. The effect of Nullification
on the Tariff should be analysed before considering
the railroad campaign, with which Calhoun could
not refrain from interfering, with results most disappointing
to those he induced to accept his view
and abandon that of his faithful friend and quondam
supporter, made by the Knoxville Convention of
1836, much more thoroughly the commercial leader
of the South than Calhoun had ever been made its
political guide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Mr. John B. Cleveland says in his pamphlet on the
“Controversy between John C. Calhoun and Robert
Y. Hayne:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There can be no question as to the sincerity of purpose or
integrity of character of Mr. Calhoun. At the same time
as the common saying is ‘he was set in his ideas’ and he
could not bear opposition.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Upon many questions he could change and did
change his views, but these changes all seem to have
proceeded from a certain development of the man
himself, not from any contact with others. So
confident was he of his own powers that he could
never profit by the realization of his mistakes. If
in one of the greatest eulogies ever delivered by a
great follower over a great leader, it could be asserted
that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is due to truth, to history and to him, to declare that
he assisted powerfully in giving currency to opinions and
building up systems that have proved seriously injurious
to the South and probably to the stability of the existing
Union.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>—</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">a critical investigation of Calhoun’s failure in
the revision of the tariff may not be without instruction;
for it was for the purpose of securing a
proper framing of such that Nullification was
launched. Later we may consider the railroad.</p>

<p>The Nullification episode has been generally
treated as a struggle between Jackson and Calhoun.
In its outward manifestations it was a contest between
the President and the State of South Carolina;
but in the settlement it really was a struggle between
Calhoun and Clay.</p>

<p>The position of Henry Clay, in 1833, was one to
test to the utmost the powers of that great politician.
In the preceding year he had sternly refused Hayne’s
amendment to his tariff bill, enacting his own view
coupled with a threat of enforcement. He had, however,
seen his Act nullified by the State of South
Carolina, under the governorship of Hayne, and
himself beaten overwhelmingly for the presidency
by Jackson, who, while threatening coercion in
South Carolina, had nevertheless, made Hayne’s
amendment to the tariff the basis of his own recommendation
on that subject to Congress. A bill had
been introduced in the House, to restore the duties
to the scale of 1816. What could Clay do to redeem
himself and his cause? Back to the Senate, in
Hayne’s vacant seat, was Clay’s “old companion at
arms with a practical power of attorney from the
recalcitrant State.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Clay at once entered into negotiations with Calhoun
himself, introducing a bill in the Senate, to
the two principles of which, viz., “that time should
be given the manufacturers and that an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad valorem</i>
duty should be provided for”, Calhoun assented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
and the bill was referred to a select committee consisting
of: Clay, Clayton, Calhoun, Grundy, Webster,
Rives, and Dallas.</p>

<p>Then up came the Revenue Collection Bill, supported
by thirty-two Senators, and passed with only
seven besides Calhoun opposing, and the great politician
from Kentucky had Calhoun safely tangled
in his net. Against the protest of the latter, he
amended his tariff bill with a provision that in the
valuation of imported articles, “the valuation should
be at the port in which the goods were imported.”
Calhoun argued that this would be a great injustice
to the South, as the price of goods being cheaper
in the Northern than in the Southern cities, a home
valuation would give the former a preference.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
But that was exactly what Clay had proposed, and
was determined to do, and although Webster and
Silsbee of Massachusetts, Hill of New Hampshire,
Dallas of Pennsylvania and Kane and Benton of Missouri
came to Calhoun’s support, Calhoun fearing
evidently to wreck his compromise with Clay, yielded
this vital point. To consider all that was involved
in the surrender of Calhoun, it will be necessary to
revert to the past and to consider some political
views emanating from the mightiest intellect South
Carolina ever produced.</p>

<p>Prior to the framing of the Constitution of the
United States and subsequent to the peace between
Great Britain and the States, the value of the imports
from Great Britain to America had exceeded
the value of the exports from America to Great Britain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
to such an amount as to be nearly three times
as great; while the commerce between the two countries
was very nearly ten times as great as that between
the States and the rest of the world. This
condition had produced anything but prosperity for
America.</p>

<p>The statesman who had contributed most to the
framing of the Constitution, Charles Pinckney, in
his effort to secure its ratification by his own State,
had made among other things this remarkable statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Foreign Trade’ is one of the enemies against which we
must be extremely guarded, more so than against any
other, as none will ever have a more unfavorable operation.
I consider it as the root of our present public distress, as
the plentiful source from which our future national calamities
will flow, unless great care is taken to prevent it.”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Thirty years later he warned Congress along similar
lines, “that a country mainly agricultural and
without mines of the precious metals, could not have
its imports greatly in excess of its exports, without
financial disaster.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>From the time of the Union to the first embargo
and the war of 1812, the immense preponderance of
the value of imports had been greatly reduced from
nearly treble to an excess of but twenty-five per
cent; but in the two years which followed the peace
they had increased to almost double the value of the
exports. Under Lowndes’s tariff of 1816 they again
fell to an excess of only about twenty per cent by
1821.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>From that period until the Compromise of 1833,
they still further fell to an excess of about eight
per cent; the value of the exports for these twelve
years being $934,287,320, and that of the imports
$1,007,853,830, a total excess of value for imports
in the twelve years amounting to $73,566,502.</p>

<p>Considering the States through which this commerce
moved, we find, with regard to Massachusetts,
for this period, the value of exports, $125,378,462;
imports, $182,861,825. Pennsylvania, exports, $86,062,157;
imports, $139,891,027. Maryland, exports,
$53,048,043; imports, $56,860,616. New York, exports,
$267,371,444; imports, $473,671,382. An excess
of imports at Northern ports of the value of
$321,000,000.</p>

<p>Now taking the Southern States for the same
period, we find Virginia, exports, $47,535,525; imports,
$7,093,499. South Carolina, exports, $93,018,377;
imports, $20,625,049. Georgia, exports, $56,167,842;
imports $5,828,581. Alabama, exports,
$14,897,425; imports, $1,631,343. Louisiana, exports,
$138,670,081; imports, $68,321,568. An excess
of exports amounting to $247,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>While, therefore, a great amount of money from
the South may have been expended for Northern
manufactures, a great deal also went out for importation
of goods through Northern markets.</p>

<p>The revision of the tariff was to correct both
wrongs.</p>

<p>But the result was simply that in a period half
as long, six years, the excess of the value of imports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
over exports for the whole country doubled and
this without any appreciable gain in the exports of
Virginia and but a slight gain, considering the
agitation, for South Carolina; or totally a condition
which, with even the greater gain of Georgia, still
left the South Atlantic States in both import and
export trade far behind the Gulf States, more
rapidly developing, and fed by the great waterway
of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>But it was when taking up for consideration the
condition of the Northern States after 1833 that
the absolute ineffectiveness of the revision of the
tariff, at that time, to cure the wrongs of trade was
most glaringly exhibited. Even with a declining
export, Massachusetts, in the six years brought in
goods to the amount of the value she had imported
in the previous twelve, and with those of Maryland,
exceeded those of the Gulf ports. The trade
of Pennsylvania was indeed crippled. But while
the exports of New York fell behind those of Louisiana,
in the value of import goods in the six years,
the importation of the previous twelve were exceeded.
The revision of the tariff in 1833 had not
only not got at the root of the trouble, it had apparently
aggravated it; for it had while injuring
Pennsylvania, stimulated Massachusetts, New York
and Maryland to make on importation what they had
lost on manufactures; while, in place of the money
so expended remaining in circulation in the United
States, a great volume of it must have gone abroad.
The panic of 1837, which came in the spring, and
which followed the greatest of New York’s importations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
a figure not attained again in fourteen
years of increasing population, had its origin in
New York. It did much to cramp the Southern railroad
movement of that date; but neither it nor the
panic of 1839 did as much to ham-string Southern
effort as the divided councils and unfortunate rivalries
of South Carolina and Georgia and Hayne and
Calhoun.</p>

<p>It might have been unreasonable to have expected
Georgians to have assisted a road to the West to
pass through North Carolina from Charleston, to
the neglect of their own State, and they had every
right to start their “rival system,” as an apologist
styles it; but for South Carolinians to abandon what
was under way in their own State backed by North
Carolina and Tennessee, however weakly, and to
pour their money into Georgia, when at the very
threshold there was refusal to permit the bridging
of the Savannah river for them, was the very extremity
of folly, no matter by whom advocated, and
for writers of history to characterize as a bubble
and fiasco the great scheme launched by the Knoxville
Convention in 1836, is simply to indicate a
lack of understanding of all that was involved in
that undertaking, and to resolutely shut eyes to the
nature of the obstructions which blocked its progress
at the time it was most essential to push it
most determinedly.</p>

<p>As it was by the railroads that the Slavery Question
was eventually settled, it is interesting to note
that the first intelligent move towards railroad construction
in the United States was contemporaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
with the great speech of Robert Y. Hayne in the
United States Senate in 1827 on the Negro Question.
Some evidence has been adduced to indicate
the probability of his responsibility for the first
suggestion of a railroad to be operated by steam
power, in the United States, in 1821 to run from
Charleston to Augusta, with a fork to Columbia.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
While Hayne may have been this early suggester,
it is quite possible and not all improbable that the
suggester, “H”, might have been Elias Horry. But
six years later, when the movement took definite
shape, Hayne in the United States Senate made an
utterance, which may be considered as, at that time,
representing the view of his section concerning the
Negro Question, viz., that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The history of the country has proved that where the
relative proportion of the colored population to the white
was greatly diminished, slaves ceased to be valuable and
emancipation followed of course ... wherever free labor
was put into full and successful operation, slave labor
ceased to be valuable.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>
</div>

<p>“Time and patience,” he had then contended, were
alone necessary to solve the Negro Problem. But
Nullification in 1832 and the Abolition ebullition
of 1835 had, however, later affected the sections
profoundly and from this latter date the political
history of the Republic depended more and more
upon the influences which could be brought to bear
upon the West by the South and the North, and upon
the South and the North by the West. Every influence
which contributed to homogeniety was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
influence towards peaceful development. That the
Hayne of 1835 was, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipsissimus verbis</i>, the Hayne of
1827 cannot be claimed; but to no statesman in the
Union was the necessity more apparent for the promotion
of this homogeneity than to him to whom
had been confided by the representatives of nine
States the stupendous task of pushing the great
Western railroad from Charleston to Cincinnati, the
front door of the great West for “free social and
commercial intercourse,”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> with:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Reciprocal dependence from Michigan to Florida, by establishing
connections in business, promoting friendships,
abolishing prejudices, creating greater uniformity in political
opinions and blending the feeling of distant portions
of the country into a union of heart.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The “rival system,” in favor of which Calhoun
abandoned Hayne’s railroad in 1838, was not in all
probability originally designed for but eventually
became the vehicle of a scheme of political conquest,
which aimed at an approach to the back door of the
West through the new State of Arkansas. This
statement may be received with impatience, but examination
will show its truth.</p>

<p>The Charleston and Hamburg Railroad was chartered
in 1828, and by 1831 was making fair progress.
There must have been in contemplation at that date,
the original plan of the fork to Columbia, and a
continuation West, through North Carolina and Tennessee;
for the first projector in Georgia, James A.
Merriwether, mentions it in a letter to Elias Horry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>of date June 8th, 1831.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In answer Elias Horry
advises him distinctly that the company desires “the
completion of a railroad, if possible, by way of the
Saluda Gap,” but sees the importance of the one
across Georgia, and advises that connection be made
with Savannah, which should reap some of the advantages
which she is entitled to.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>In the very year in which Calhoun was advising
the people:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“if all other effectual resistance should fail, it would be
their duty to take measures to concentrate the voice of the
South, which should plainly announce to their Northern
brethren that either the Bill (Force) or the political connection
must yield:—”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">in his report on the completion of the Charleston
and Hamburg Railroad in 1833, Elias Horry alludes
to the “Western and Atlantic Railroad Convention”
held in Asheville, North Carolina, September 3rd,
1832, for a “Railroad up the French Broad River,”
at which were pointed out the many and great advantages
that would be produced ... not less in a
political than in a commercial point of view, so
indissolubly connecting the Southern and Western
interests, strengthening the bonds of union and
thereby perpetuating all the blessings of our valuable
institutions.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>But with the death of Horry in 1834, the project
seems to have slumbered until, in October, 1835, a
well thought out statement, emanating from a group<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
of citizens of Ohio, one of whom was General Harrison,
brought the matter up again,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and on July
4th, 1836, delegates from Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky,
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama and Tennessee, at Knoxville, launched the
Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad to
connect the West and South. Hayne became President
of the company and Calhoun a Director. From
the outset, however, Calhoun was a continually disturbing
element. He was never able to shake off
the view that railroads, if not adjuncts to water
courses, would be failures. It was a natural view
in his day, if it was an ignorant one, and one honestly
held; but it was injurious to the enterprise.</p>

<p>His known distrust of the route through North
Carolina chilled the enthusiasm of the people of
North Carolina.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> He deserted the South Carolina
Company at the most critical time, when the prospects
of the rival enterprise through Georgia seemed
fairest. His powerful obstructive force arrested
the Carolina road at Columbia, by a declaration pertinaciously
sought to be made in advance that it
should not go further<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and by so doing diverted to
the “rival system” in Georgia, funds in South Carolina
which most materially aided in preserving the
Georgia venture from utter failure, when it had
collapsed, with unaccounted funds, to the extent of
$2,602,457,26;<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> while his sadly triumphant designation
of Hayne’s road as an ended “humbug,” one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
year after Hayne’s death, when it was at last determined
that it should not go beyond Columbia,
has been accepted at its face value by those more inclined
to believe it, than to take the trouble to examine
the facts.</p>

<p>Yet Calhoun, himself, although he survived Hayne
eleven years, died before the “rival system” was
assured; and nine years after his own death, when,
as yet, no great benefits to South Carolina trade
had accrued from the construction of the Georgia
road, a vigorous attempt was made to resurrect the
French Broad route, with a declaration that only
the gap from Spartanburg, South Carolina, to Paint
Rock, on the Tennessee-North Carolina line, remained
to be closed, C. G. Memminger, in opposing
the resurrection of the L. C. &amp; C. R. R., made the
statement concerning it, that “it had been the mother
of all our interior railroads, and had not cost the
State a dollar of her money.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>If such a statement could be made in 1858 by one
who, while he had materially assisted it up to 1839,
had then opposed it, it may be well to consider how
the scheme was regarded in Europe, at the date at
which Mr. Memminger led the movement for the
stopping it at Columbia, evidently so as to concentrate
all effort on the route through Georgia.</p>

<p>In the work of Alexander Trotter, of London,
England, published in 1839, appears three allusions
to Hayne’s Western road. One in the general discussion
of conditions in the United States at large;
one in the chapter treating of the State of South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Carolina; and one in that discussing Ohio. The
first is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Besides the outlet for their produce which the Ohio
and Mississippi afford to cultivators, the State of Pennsylvania
has established a communication on the former
river by a series of canals and railroads, and has opened
to them the market of the Atlantic cities. The State of
New York, by means of the Erie Canal, has procured for
them a similar advantage at a port more to the North, while
a still more gigantic undertaking than either of these works
is now in progress to connect the city of Cincinnati with
Charleston, which will bring the products of these distant
lands to the markets of the Southern Atlantic States.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In that portion of his work which treats of South
Carolina, Mr. Trotter enters more particularly into
the plan of the connection:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The work contemplated by this company (The Louisville,
Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad) is the establishment
of a railroad communication between the city of Charleston
and the Ohio. The distance between Charleston and
Cincinnati in a straight line, is about five hundred miles.
Several routes have been surveyed by which the length of
the railroad will be about six hundred, but no line seems
to have been definitely fixed upon. A railroad called the
South Carolina, already exists between Charleston and Hamburg,
a town situated on the Savannah opposite to Augusta,
in Georgia, this railroad has been purchased by the company,
and will be made use of as far as Branchville or
Aiken. One plan is to carry the road projected from the
former to Columbia, the seat of Government in South Carolina,
and then up the valley of the Broad river into the
State of North Carolina. After surmounting the Blue Ridge
by inclined planes with stationary engines, the road would
by this plan, be carried down the valley of the French Broad
River to Knoxville, in Tennessee, and thence through Cumberland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
Gap, to Lexington in Kentucky; from the latter city
separate roads would proceed to Louisville, Cincinnati and
Mayesville. The distance from Charleston to Cincinnati by
this route would be 607 miles.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Alluding to the Georgia route, he indicates the
first as likely the route to be decided upon finally,
and in the remarkably accurate map, for that date,
shows that the line through North Carolina, is
shorter by something like a fifth of the distance and
that “the success of the South Carolina Railroad
holds out a fair prospect for that of the greater
work” as it—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“although thus successful had to contend with great disadvantages;
it was not only the first railroad attempted in
the Southern States, but was at the time it was completed
the longest railroad that had been constructed in any part
of the world ... so that the projectors could derive little
benefit from the experience of other works of a similar nature—the
whole work too, which is a singular circumstance,
was executed by the black population. In addition to these
drawbacks, the limited means of the company caused the
work to be executed in a very imperfect manner.... The
original cost of the road was $904,500.00 but the filling up
of the spaces between the piles and other expenses increased
the cost up to the 31st of October 1834 to $1,336,615.09.
The present company have almost reconstructed the whole
work; two-thirds of the purchase money which has been paid,
together with the expenses which have already been incurred,
having amounted to nearly two million of dollars.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Georgia had started its system from a point afterwards
becoming Atlanta, towards which two roads
were pointing, one from Augusta about due west<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
and another from Savannah northwest to Macon,
from which by an inclination north it moved towards
the same point.</p>

<p>Hayne’s review of the commercial situation in the
spring of 1838 indicated how clearly he grasped the
fact that the revision of the tariff had failed to cure
the conditions under which the South labored; for
exporting more than a sixth of the total exports of
the country, the three States of Virginia, South
Carolina and Georgia imported less than one fortieth.
If the South could only have been made to
see it before the opportunity passed. His comment
put it fairly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Look at the present course of trade between the South
and the West. The importations from Tennessee and Kentucky
into South Carolina and Georgia amount to millions
of dollars, but instead of their being paid for in foreign
goods imported directly into Charleston and Savannah in
exchange for our own cotton and rice, we pay for them in
gold or silver or in bills upon the North, thereby losing
entirely the profits on the importation and greatly embarrassing
our merchants by the operation. Now if we only
had the means of transporting these goods by railroad to the
West, everything would be changed. Not only would we pay
for Western production consumed by the South, in foreign
goods received in exchange for our own produce, but we
should be able to supply a large portion of the Western
country with all the goods now obtained by them from
abroad, receiving in exchange their products to be distributed
in Southern ships throughout the world. The truth
is that all our efforts to establish a direct trade with Europe
must in a great measure be unavailing unless we can provide
a market in the West for the goods we may import. Our
railroad with the aid of the South Western Railroad Bank,
will achieve for us this important and peaceful victory.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>But Kentucky and Tennessee did not constitute
all that the railroad to Cincinnati led to. The description
given by the English student of American
affairs in 1839, shows what Ohio was at that date:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Of the 75 counties of which it is composed, 14 lie upon
the Ohio River, which in its windings bounds the State for
436 miles; while seven which border on Lake Erie possess
a coast of upwards of 200 miles in extent. The great works
which have been described, and others the result of private
enterprise, have given almost equal advantage to the interior
districts. Canals now made or making pass through 32
counties, railroads through six, and macadamized roads
through five, so that of the 75 counties into which the State
is divided, there are only 11 which do not benefit from
either natural or improved means of communication, and
many even of these are traversed or bounded by rivers of
inferior magnitude. While its natural advantages and the
industry of its inhabitants have thus secured for this State
the benefits of an easy internal communication, its position
is no less favorable for external commerce. The Ohio River
affords a direct communication with all the country in the
valley of the Mississippi, which requires much of its agricultural
produce and of its manufactures while by means of
Lake Erie, which has several good natural or artificial harbors,
it communicates with Canada and New York on the
one side and with the country of the upper lakes on the
other.... When the communication is complete between the
Ohio and Pennsylvania lines, and still more when the railroad
is finished which is meant to connect Cincinnati with
Charleston, in South Carolina, an additional stimulus will
be given to the industry of the State. The completion of the
latter work, by the importance it will confer on Cincinnati,
is scarcely of less interest to Ohio than it is to the States
whose territories it traverses.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It was from Ohio in 1835 that the movement had
come headed by General Harrison, for railroad connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
with South Carolina. We have discussed
commercial conditions. What of political? Professor
Paxson says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Southern counties of the old Northwest were never
unanimous for slavery, but they were thoroughly impregnated
with the ideals of the South before the Northern tier
of counties had been surveyed or cleared of Indians. North
of the National Road (from Wheeling to Columbus, Indianapolis,
Vandalia and St. Louis) roughly speaking, was the
zone of the Erie Canal—by 1840 a new New England stood
rival to a northern South within the three oldest States of
the old Northwest. For another twenty years, from the
election of Harrison to that of Lincoln, the political future
of the section was indeterminate.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But in 1835 Calhoun had been convinced that the
movement of population and industry was towards
Arkansas,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and that consequently “we should look
much further West than Cincinnati or Lexington”.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
This he announced in his letter to Hayne resigning
from his position as one of the directors of the
Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad in
1838.</p>

<p>On what did he base the view? The Census
figures of 1830 as compared with those of 1820 indicated
that the increase of population of Indiana,
Illinois, and Michigan, were all greater than the
increase in Arkansas, even if the increase of Ohio’s
581,295 to 937,903 was not as great a percentage of
increase as that of Arkansas from 14,314, to 33,388
in the same period. Nevertheless at the time when
the road was determined to be stopped at Columbia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
South Carolina, in favor of the movement to be
worked out through Georgia to Arkansas, the white
population of Ohio was 1,502,122, the colored 17,345.
At the same date the white population of Arkansas
was 77,174, the colored 20,865. If it be claimed that
north of Arkansas was Missouri with a white population
of 323,888 and a colored population of 61,388;
yet, if we took the three States just north of Kentucky
and across the Ohio River and the State of
Michigan just beyond, we will know that the region
which held 2,864,634 whites and 29,483 colored
was abandoned to build to a region inhabited by
401,662 whites and 82,253 colored persons. Was
this a reasonable commercial movement? If it was
not, what was it? An attempt will be made to answer
these two questions in the two following chapters,
which attempt should open with some description
of railroad movement in the North and West.</p>

<p>Realizing what a great benefit the Erie Canal had
been to New York, by 1834, Pennsylvania had connected
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh by canals, the
greater part of which had been completed by 1832;<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
but with the revision of the tariff of 1833, so injurious
to her, as has been shown, she bent every
effort to supplement her waterways with railroads,
and, by 1835, there were some 200 miles of railroads
in the State.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The bulk of these it is true were
coal roads, but by 1839, a railroad had been completed
from Philadelphia to Columbia (Pa.) 82 miles
in length, and there was in process of construction
41¾ miles additional in a southwestwardly direction
to Gettysburg.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Philadelphia also had a railroad
connection with New York to the North and Baltimore
to the South.</p>

<p>In New York by 1836, railroad communication between
Albany and Utica was open for traffic,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and
work was being pushed on the Erie railroad, starting
from lower down on the Hudson towards Lake
Erie.</p>

<p>In Maryland, the Baltimore and Ohio, begun
about the same time as the Charleston and Hamburg,
but, not as soon used for steam power operation,
had by 1834 reached Harper’s Ferry, 82
miles.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> There it connected by a viaduct over the
Potomac River, with the Winchester Railroad, which
by 1839, ran down the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
for 30 miles. A branch to Washington, some
33 miles in length, connected with the Richmond and
Potomac Railroad<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> 70 miles in length, opened for
traffic in 1836.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> From Richmond, south, ran the
Richmond and Petersburg Railroad, in process of
construction, and from Petersburg to Blakely, in
North Carolina, complete, by 1839, to Wilmington
by 1840.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>By 1842 the New York Central reached Buffalo,
while, at the same time, Boston linked up with
Albany.</p>

<p>The above vindicates the warning which Hayne
issued to the people of South Carolina in 1835,
upon the call from Ohio for Southern railroad connection,
viz., that “New York, Boston, Philadelphia
and Baltimore were moving for what was offered
Charleston.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In 1838 he declared to the people of
Charleston:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If after all we have said and done, we should falter
in our course, our sister cities will very soon establish these
connections, by which our doom will be sealed, and we shall
deserve our fate.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To the people of South Carolina he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is impossible to shut our eyes to the fact that South
Carolina is destined to sink down from her high and palmy
state of prosperity ... unless her sons shall avail themselves
of the present favorable opportunity.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>Six months later, when striving to induce Calhoun
to reconsider his announced resignation from the
Directorship of the L. C. &amp; C. Co., he admitted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Should your influence be thrown against us, our whole
project in all its parts may fail.”—</p>
</div>

<p>But he also warned him, with true prophetic
power, that cooperation with those he was deserting
was: “the only plan, be assured, by which ever your
views can be affected.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Set and hardened in his
views, Calhoun refused to be influenced by any argument,
threw his influence against the plan, and considered
the stopping of Hayne’s road at Columbia,
one year after Hayne’s death, a personal triumph.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
He thus destroyed the plan of a connection with Cincinnati,
to which from the outset he had been opposed,
although in veiled phrases,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> on account of
his determination to secure the combination of political
and commercial benefits, which he was convinced
must flow from a railroad across Tennessee
to Arkansas. It is true that at the time of his
resignation from the Carolina enterprise, 2000 men
were at work on the line from Atlanta to Chattanooga,
and expectation keen that by the fall of 1839,
one hundred of the 138 miles would be finished; but
without a precise statement of account to indicate
how the expenditure of $2,602,457.26 had been incurred,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
this work was suspended in 1841, without
even the laying of the iron; which suspension
stopped as well the Georgia and the Georgia Central
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>with 88 and 95 miles respectively from Augusta and
Savannah, with some sixty miles still intervening
between their most extended work and the southern
point in this link of their chain to the West. It also
stopped work from Nashville down towards the
Northern point at Chattanooga. The suspension
occurred just two years after the death of Hayne,
and but one after the persistent resolve to stop work
on the South Carolina Road at Columbia and dissolve
the relations between it and Tennessee and North
Carolina had been affected. To those who had effected
this disastrous result it, therefore, became
absolutely essential to push the Georgia road on to
completion; which was effected by 1845.</p>

<p>“New subscriptions from Charleston and Augusta
to the stock of the company, it seems, were largely
responsible for the hastening of the road to completion”;<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
but what portion of the cost, $3,328,594,
was borne by the contributors from South Carolina
does not clearly appear. What is known, however,
is that General Gadsden, who owed his elevation to
the presidency of the South Carolina Railroad to
the powerful assistance of Calhoun, contemporaneously
with the completion of the Georgia Railroad in
1845, wrote to Calhoun urging him to attend the
railroad convention to be held at Memphis the same
year, declaring in his letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are on the eve of realizing all our fond hopes and
expectations of 1836 ... Now is the time to meet our Western
friends at Memphis—to set the ball in motion which
will bring the valley to the South.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>From 1836 to 1838, Calhoun was a director in
the South Carolina enterprise, Gadsden its most inveterate
foe.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>F. H. Elmore was more definite in his endorsement
of the road to Memphis. He wrote Calhoun:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A railroad communication based at Memphis, in a slave
region and extended direct to Charleston, passing through
the most martial portion of our people, and who have, as at
present situated, the least interest of all the South in slavery,
would render their relations with us at Charleston and
Memphis so intimate and advantageous that their interests
and ours would be indissolubly united. They would be to
us a source of strength, power and safety, and render the
South invulnerable.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Of course it was not only possible, but not at all
improbable, that in pressing the original route along
the line from Charleston to Cincinnati, free labor
might have injured the institution of slavery in
South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee, even
more than familiarity with it might have softened
the feelings of the inhabitants of Ohio, Indiana and
Illinois towards slavery. But whichever way it
worked, it must have knit more firmly together the
sections, by the identity of thought, which would
have made itself felt with closer commercial intercourse.
What Elmore hoped to sustain in 1845,
Conner saw beginning to crumble in 1849, for he
writes Calhoun at that date:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The cities all of them are becoming daily more and
more unsound, and all for the same reason. The infusion
of Northerners and foreigners amongst them. And their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
interest is being felt in the interior. The draymen and
laborers of New Orleans are all white and foreigners, and
they will not let a Negro drive a dray. He would be mobbed
or killed. The steamboats all employ white servants, and
their captains are mostly Northerners, and the issue of Free
Labor against Slave Labor will soon be made at the South.
Our own people many of them are desponding. They begin
to think that the institution of Slavery is doomed.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the light of this letter in 1849, we may well
ponder what might not have been accomplished for
peace had not what might have become a great artery
of trade between Cincinnati and Charleston been
so recklessly cut in 1840. It is hardly possible to
doubt, that in the cutting, commercial conditions
were made absolutely subservient to political in the
cultivated growth concerning the Institution in
which the disciples were continually forging ahead
of the masters and teachers.</p>

<p>In 1846 Calhoun had suggested, to J. H. Hammond,
the propriety of eulogizing Rev. Henry Bascomb
for his vindication of the South on the occasion
of the division of the Methodists, and Hammond
had replied at some length with a declination.
Calhoun’s rejoinder is of some interest:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I concur in the opinion that we ought to take the highest
ground on the subject of African Slavery, as it exists
among us, and have from the first acted accordingly; but
we must not break with or throw off those who are not prepared
to come up to our standard, especially on the exterior
limits of the slave holding States. I look back with
pleasure to the progress which sound principles have made
within the past ten years in respect to the relations between
the two races. All, with a very few exceptions, defended it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
a short time since on the ground of a necessary evil to be
got rid of as soon as possible. South Carolina was not
much sounder 20 years ago than Kentucky now is and I
cannot but think the course the Western Baptist and Methodists
took in reference to the division of their churches
has done much to expel C. Clay and correct public opinion
in that quarter.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Now if we go back twenty years from this expression
of Calhoun’s, we will be within one year of the
date of Hayne’s great speech in the United States
Senate of 1827. In the twenty years, as well as
can be arrived at, the whites had increased to the
extent of about fifty per cent, the Negroes to the extent
of about sixty per cent. Apparently he had
expected too much. The increase rate of the whites
had not been as great as that of the Negroes, no
matter what were the causes, and with the increase,
the estimate of the Institution increased. In the
light of these facts it is scarcely surprising that in
1848, although railroads from Columbia to two
points on the North Carolina line, were again under
way, and an application for a charter for a third,
along Hayne’s route to Spartanburg, pending, the
City of Charleston was induced to give $500,000 to
complete the railroad from Nashville to Chattanooga,
in spite of the protest<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> of some of the citizens
of Charleston, that it was not right to use
corporate funds for work outside of the State, and
even if it was, it was not expedient to do so, as long
as Augusta refused, as she was then refusing, to
permit a bridge to be built across the Savannah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
River at the terminus of the Hamburg road, by
which alone the South Carolina Railroad could connect
with the Georgia system.</p>

<p>Upon Calhoun’s return from the trip to the West
which had been urged upon him by the president
of the South Carolina Railroad, Gadsden, he expressed
himself to his son-in-law, Clemson, as satisfied
with his reception in Memphis and elsewhere;
but he could hardly have been pleased at the tone
taken by Gadsden very shortly after with regard to
the tariff.</p>

<p>Mention has previously been made with regard
to what is herein considered Calhoun’s failure in
1833 to cope successfully with Clay; but the very
slight gains then secured were wiped out in a new
tariff in 1842. In 1846, being free from the terrific
responsibilities and overshadowing dangers of Nullification,
Calhoun secured legislation, which seems
in its workings to have balanced very satisfactorily
the imports and exports of the country, being apparently
passed upon the sound principles of Lowndes’s
legislation. But the effort drew from Gadsden’s
swollen greatness, this insolent characterization
of the main creator of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The passage of the tariff has pleased, but not satisfied
us. Perhaps it was the best terms which at this crisis
could be got, and doing away with the minimums and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad valorem</i> duty is a point gained. The valuation is ambiguous.
Whether on the foreign or the home we cannot
understand. The bill may be construed either way. The
Pennsylvanians really seem to control you.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>The conclusion must have been galling, and it was
followed in 1847 with another letter in which, with
professions of devotion, it was intimated that General
Taylor’s candidacy for the Presidency would
be a serious impediment to the only kind of candidacy
Calhoun could undertake. Whether Mr. Gadsden
received the early answer he requested on the ground
“that the concert of action may be certain to secure
the triumph of one, who will not court our influence
to deceive,”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> does not appear; but the next year
there was a strong movement, led by George A.
Trenholm of Charleston, to oust Gadsden from the
presidency of the railroad, and in the last two years
of his life, Calhoun’s intimacy with Gadsden is not
evidenced by any correspondence. Rather it was
upon Hammond that he leant more and more and it
was to him that he addressed the last letter written
to any one beyond the immediate circle of his own
hearthstone.</p>

<p>To Hammond the dying statesman turned with a
confidence calculated to inspire the latter’s belief in
himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Without flattery I know of no one better informed than
you are on the subject that now agitates the country, or
more capable of deciding what should be done, with the
knowledge you would acquire of the state of things here or
of preparing whatever papers the Convention may think
proper to put out.... Never before has the South been
placed in so trying a situation, nor can it ever be placed in
one more so. Her all is at stake.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>The convention was the Nashville Convention of
1850, which met a few months after Calhoun’s death.
Hammond and many others hoped to have had Calhoun’s
advice at it, and possibly the suggestion for
a new Constitution framed by Calhoun. They believed
emancipation was impending, and that with
it the South would be reduced to the condition of
Hayti. Hammond had declared to Calhoun:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We must act now and decisively.... If we do not act
now, we deliberately consign, not our posterity, but our
children to the flames. What a holocaust for us to place
upon the alter of that union for which the South and West
have had such a bigoted and superstitious veneration.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The brilliant follower had passed quite beyond
his leader. The orator who eight years later defiantly
declared in the United States Senate, “Cotton
is King,” tersely states in this letter his political
creed, viz., that:</p>

<p>“The fundamental object of government is to secure the
fruits of labor and skill—that is to say property, and that
its forms must be moulded upon the social organizations.
Life and liberty will then be secured, for these are naturally
under the guardianship of society and that civilization which
is the fruit of its progress. ‘Free government’ and all that
sort of thing has been, I think, a fatal delusion and humbug
from the time of Moses. Freedom does not spring from
government, but from the same soil which produces government
itself, and all that we want from that is a guarantee
for property fairly acquired.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>
</div>

<p>His conclusion was: “If leaders will only lead,
neither they nor we have anything to fear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Property is said to be proverbially timid, and the
powers of finance to dread war and its confusion;
but Hammond’s conclusion was identical with that
if the greatest banker of Charleston, of that day,
who in the previous year had informed Calhoun
after an extended journey, that the South was
“ready to act.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>With Calhoun’s death, however, the party of action
was without any recognized head. There was
no South Carolinian, who could in 1850 take his
place without question, and accordingly by 1852, the
leadership of the South passed to Georgia from
South Carolina, and to some extent it did so pass
from and through the blind efforts of the Titan of
South Carolina to mould all things to his will; for
it was through Calhoun to a considerable extent,
that Georgia had secured and waxed fat upon the
great railroad up into Tennessee and to the West.
As soon as the Western and Atlantic, from Atlanta,
reached Chattanooga, meeting there in 1851, the road
from Nashville, which ran some 35 miles from
Chattanooga towards the West, another subscription
was secured from Charleston,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> for a road
thence to that point on the Mississippi river opposite
Arkansas, although, in this instance, with some glimmer
of sense, it was conditioned upon the removal
of the obstruction caused by the city of Augusta’s
refusal to permit a bridge from the South Carolina
shore across the Savannah river, by which alone connection
with the railroad beyond could be made from
South Carolina. But it was only, when, in despair of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
accomplishing this bridging of the Savannah river
in 1852,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> $500,000 was given to aid in pushing the
South Carolina road on from Anderson, S. C., to
Knoxville, Tennessee, that then, by purchase from
Augusta, the right to bridge the Savannah river and
connect with the Georgia Railroad was obtained;
so that, in the end, some hundred or more miles of
railroad had to be built beyond Columbia in South
Carolina, merely to secure the connection with the
Georgia road in 1853, for which Hayne’s great road
had been stopped at Columbia in 1840. But by
1853, the futility of any hope of great benefit to
South Carolina trade from the Georgia connection
having possessed the minds of those directing affairs
in South Carolina, $500,000 from Charleston and
$1,000,000<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> from the State was granted to promote
the second of the two routes with which Calhoun
had obstructed the French Broad Railway
from its inception. For five years, with repeated
disasters, the construction of this second string to
the bow of Calhoun, was energetically pushed, with
the vain hope of securing for South Carolina, at that
late day, what had been thrown away eighteen years
earlier in blind obedience to a great man’s imperious
dictation. And it was in asking for an additional
$1,000,000 from the State and resisting the arguments
concerning the resurrection of the French
Broad route that Mr. Memminger, later Secretary
of the Treasury of Confederate States, declared of
Hayne’s railroad:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Although that great work was abandoned from causes
beyond our control, yet it has been the mother of all our
interior railroads and has not cost the State a single dollar
of her money.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If there was anything which could have been said
to have further accentuated the fatal folly of the
abandonment of this great enterprise in favor of
the attempted junction with the Georgia roads in
1840 and a route to Arkansas instead of Ohio, it was
epitomized unconsciously by the same speaker, Mr.
Memminger, at the same time in 1858, in the same
speech, from which the above extract was taken:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The two roads to the West, which have been assisted by
Charleston are the Memphis and the Nashville Railroads....
We hoped that they would bring trade to the city,
but it finds a cheaper outlet by the Mississippi river.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>
</div>

<p>One word more with regard to the cost of this
road, which if it had not been stopped at Columbia,
might possibly have prevented the war between the
States. In the three years from 1836 to 1839 the
old Hamburg Railroad, run down and out of condition,
had been purchased and put into such order
as to raise the receipts from it fifty per cent, by
1839. Seventeen miles had been built on the fork
to Columbia from Branchville, with preparations
so well forward that to the $1,858,772 spent on the
153 miles, $584,304 additional, it was estimated,
would enable the remaining 48 to be completed in a
year to Columbia, with about $1,300,000 additional
to be spent to reach the North Carolina line by
1846, when the total expenditure of the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
from Charleston to Augusta and from Branchville
through Columbia to the North Carolina line via
Spartanburg, would have reached $3,743,076. At
that point $1,102,600 pledged by North Carolina and
Tennessee would have been obtained, which with the
work done and prepared for was all lost by the
stoppage at Columbia. Yet nine years after Hayne’s
death, 1848, the report of the president of the South
Carolina Railroad, James Gadsden, shows $5,546,735.48<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
spent in securing only an additional 51
miles of roadway.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p>The school of Georgia politicians in 1852 did not
favor Secession. Their objection to it was that it
would so reduce the value of slaves as to force the
owners to emancipate them themselves; while, with
the preservation of the Union, they believed they
could force slavery to the Pacific.</p>

<p>Certainly Georgia was in many respects amply
fitted to lead. By the census of 1850 it was disclosed
that in the value of her personal property, returned
for taxation, she led the Union with $213,499,486.
Twelve million more than the old and
wealthy State of Massachusetts, which returned
$201,976,892. South Carolina came third with
$178,130,217. Alabama fourth with $162,463,700.
New York fifth with $150,719,379.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>In the value of their real estate, which could not
be as well concealed as their personal property, the
Northern States stood out richer, so that in her
revenue, Georgia stood not higher than seventh,
among the States of the Union; but, when revenue,
expenditure and debt were considered together, no
State in the Union was apparently in such an eminently
sound and healthy condition; for, with her
surplus, she could have extinguished her debt in
five years.</p>

<p>Of course that which made the personal property
returned for taxation by the residents of the Southern
States, stand out so greatly in excess of that of
the richer States of the North was the fact that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
bulk of it was in slaves. But that fact reveals why
the institution of slavery had such a hold upon the
South, when not more than ten per cent of its inhabitants
were slave holders. If the statesmen and
politicians who supported and defended it demanded
“a guarantee for property fairly acquired,” that
property bore the bulk of the tax. That was not
the condition of the North, and the vice of the more
advanced civilization of that section was that, by
every device which could be conceived, more and
more the burden of taxation was thrown upon the
poor.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>While not to the swollen condition that is apparent
today, the North was, for thirty years and more
prior to the War between the States, the land of the
capitalist, the abode of American capital.</p>

<p>How far the determination of Northern capital
to keep the South financially tributary to it was
responsible for the rapid railroad development of
the North and West, it will require much investigation
to disclose. Whether, with a higher and nobler
personnel among its leaders and greater regard
for the toiling masses of its white population, it
could have prepared the way so thoroughly for the
conquest of the South is doubtful; but having been
stricken a blow, even if a weak one, by the tariff
of 1833, with a home valuation it had parried the
blow and sustained itself on the increased import
trade until it could enact the tariff of 1842; and
when that was replaced by Calhoun’s tariff of 1846,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
marshalling its industrial dependents, it reached out
with splendid energy, with one hand grasping the
South and the other the West and bound them both
to its girdle with bands of steel.</p>

<p>We have seen what was attempted in the South
in the political commercial effort to stretch from the
Atlantic to Arkansas, after the abandonment of the
movement to Cincinnati in 1840. Now reverting to
the West, we find that in Ohio, part of the Cincinnati,
Sandusky and Cleveland Railroad was built
in 1837; but it was not until 1848 that it was completed.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>In Kentucky, of the 97 miles projected, by 1839,
there were in operation from Lexington to Frankfort,
on one end, 28 miles; from Louisville to Portland
on the other end, 3 miles.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> But within nine
years from the time at which the Louisville, Cincinnati
and Charleston Railroad was stopped at
Columbia, a railroad extended from Detroit across
lower Michigan, and by 1851, Cleveland and Pittsburgh
were connected by rail; while a second line
from Toledo below Detroit, paralleled the road from
Detroit to the lower end of Lake Michigan. By
1853, down from Lake Michigan to the junction of
the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, a line continued
these two from Toledo and Detroit; while from
Cleveland a network of roads reached Indianapolis,
sending out from that city a line West to Terre
Haute and one North to Lake Michigan. By 1857
this had become a perfect mesh of railroads, crossing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
and recrossing Ohio, Indiana and Illinois and
reaching up into Wisconsin, while three constituent
roads stretched across from the North Atlantic
Coast to the Mississippi River opposite Missouri.</p>

<p>The situation with regard to population was about
as follows at this period: The three States mentioned
above contained about 4,500,000 white inhabitants,
which the population of Michigan, Wisconsin
and Iowa raised to about 6,000,000. Behind
them were banked some 11,000,000 whites in New
York, Pennsylvania and New England.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to the Nashville Convention of 1850,
South Carolina had sent a representative, who might
have been considered a leaf from her great past,
Langdon Cheves and against the independent secession
of South Carolina, he strove successfully.</p>

<p>Mr. G. M. Pinckney, the most sympathetic of all
Calhoun’s biographers, thus sums up the situation
in 1850:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If Mr. Calhoun had lived a little longer, it seems highly
probable that history would have been different. He certainly
would have forced matters to head at this session,
and at this time, had the South taken definite action it
seems probable that there was left genuine love enough
for the Union on all sides to save it. To delay ten years
was necessarily fatal. Every moment lost but added fuel
to the kindling flame of sectional hatred. Mr. Calhoun’s
death was a stunning blow. The South fell into confusion.
Delay resulted and natural causes taking their course produced
natural results.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Professor Paxson’s view of the situation for the
same time seems somewhat in accord with the above:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Had the secession movement of 1850 grown into war,
none of these factors (i. e. railroads) would have been effective,
and success for separation could hardly have been
questioned. But in 1860 secession came too late. The Northwest
was crossed and recrossed by an intricate entanglement
of tracks.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Such a coincidence of view in such widely separated
quarters is entitled to the highest respect;
but it is not the view entertained by the writer of
this work, to whom 1850 seems to have been too late
to affect the situation favorably for secession, even
if Calhoun had survived; for, judged by his career,
it is exceedingly doubtful if he would have forced
matters to a head. It would not have been in accord
with his past. He was a great parliamentarian
and an even greater debater; but all through his
career his hand had been forced. He was never
quite ready for the situation as it developed. It
may have been greatly to his credit and consistent
with his views; but he always consulted and pondered.
His political methods so disclose him. McDuffie
forced his hand with regard to Nullification.
Clay forced his hand with regard to the tariff of
1833. For Rhett’s resolution of 1838, he was not
ready, although that was the logical time and the
logical course.</p>

<p>Those who feel, that for this great Republic a
world task was and is reserved, may rejoice that no
effort to secede was moved in 1838, but that does
not effect the question of its possible success had it
been attempted. Conditions in South Carolina were
very much confused by Calhoun’s death. To supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
his place in the United States Senate, Governor
Seabrook first appointed F. H. Elmore and, upon his
death in a month or two, Robert W. Barnwell, but
upon the meeting of the General Assembly of South
Carolina, six months later, that body elected R.
Barnwell Rhett, who, for about a year and a quarter,
strove for the accomplishment of the policy of
secession and failing, resigned and gave way to
W. F. DeSaussure, apparently in accord with the
Georgia policy of pushing slavery to the Pacific,
within the Union, and in the wake of Georgia, South
Carolina moved until 1860, when her representatives
again took the initiative with the full approval
of the leaders of the Empire State of the South.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>For the carrying into effect, in 1850, of the Georgia
scheme of pushing slavery to the Pacific there
were in Missouri 592,004 whites, in Arkansas 163,189,
and in Kentucky and Tennessee 1,518,247, to
which the entire South remaining could add 3,422,923,
and even if Arkansas had doubled her white
population since 1840, the 450,000 whites with which
Ohio’s population had been increased in the same
time, put in that State one-tenth of the total white
population of the Union, which, with that with
which Indiana and Illinois disposed of in about the
same space as Kentucky and Tennessee below, furnished
fully two and a half times as many to draw
upon. It should have been apparent, therefore, that
it would take all that the South could do to hold Missouri,
much less invade the further Northwest, even
if Iowa, at that, time did not have very many more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
white inhabitants than Arkansas. There was a
chance to have affected Ohio in 1840; but by 1855
the movement from the East and the railroads had
made it the powerful advanced outpost of the Abolitionists.
The ten years between 1838 and 1848
practically determined the course of events, making
more and more for war between the slowly
separating sections, and for the steadily increasing
black population of slaves in the South.</p>

<p>If it is true that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Transportation, after all, has determined both the course
and the period of Western development.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">—the colonizing stream with which the great and
populous State of Ohio, from 1840 fecundated the
prairies of the West might have poured to a considerable
extent into the valleys of the Blue Ridge, the
Alleghany and the Cumberland mountains along the
lines of the Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston
Railroad to meet and mingle with the stream which
had been moving westward from South Carolina,
since 1820.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In such a case the country might and
in all probability would have developed at a slower
pace; but it would have been as a more homogeneous
people. It is idle to declare that there was an irrepressible
conflict. That has always been the claim
of those who are determined to precipitate such and
are absolutely dead to—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“the influence of a free, social and commercial intercourse,
in softening asperities, removing prejudices, extending
knowledge and promoting human happiness.”</p>

</div>

<p>The presidential election of 1852, tended at first
to allay excitement. A New Englander, affiliating
closely with Southern men, Franklin Pierce, of New
Hampshire, won the Democratic nomination over
competitors much more prominent. Of these competitors
Buchanan and Cass had long and intimately
been connected with the party leaders of their States
in the time of Andrew Jackson; trained in the old
school of politics; drawing what strength they had
from faithful service. The third competitor, a comparatively
new leader in the West, forceful, aggressive
and impatient of restraint, Stephen A. Douglas,
was of an entirely different type. Determined to
make a spoon or spoil a horn, he evolved the doctrine
of squatter sovereignty, and with it soon had
the country in a turmoil.</p>

<p>The condition was strange. The Georgians had
a policy and the lead of a section, but no man among
them possessed the qualities essential for such a
task, as their bold program of pushing slavery to the
Pacific within the Union, demanded. Howell Cobb
approached nearer the station of leader than any
other man of his State; but he scarcely measured
up to what was required. Besides as great as Georgia
was among the Southern States, second only to
Virginia, in point of population, and quite beyond
in wealth and resources, among the States of the
Union, in point of population, she barely ranked
tenth. From the continuous stream of white immigrants
pouring into Illinois that great State was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
however, rapidly moving up to the position of fourth
in population, while in Stephen A. Douglas, she
possessed one of the most audacious and resourceful
of politicians who had ever moved in the affairs
of the Union, to a great height. Carrying at his
heels some forty-two Northern votes in Congress, he
appeared to be just the man the Georgians needed,
and accordingly in the Congress which met in December,
1853, he introduced his bill for the organization
of the territory of Nebraska, framing the provisions
thereof upon the precedents set in the organization
of the territories of Utah and New
Mexico four years before. Of this bill, a distinguished
author, later president of the United States,
has said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No bolder or more extraordinary measure had ever been
proposed in Congress, and it came upon the country like a
thief in the night, without warning or expectation, when
parties were trying to sleep off the excitement of former
debates about the extension of slavery.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Woodrow Wilson was of the opinion that
Southern members had never dreamed of demanding
such a measure and that no one but Douglas,
would have dreamed of offering it to them; but yet
he says the President had been consulted and had
given his approval to it, upon the ground that “it
was founded upon a sound principle which the compromise
of 1820 had infringed upon.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> And certain
it is that the President had consulted, concerning
it, that Southerner who was destined to occupy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
the most prominent position ever held by a Southerner.
Jefferson Davis knew of it.</p>

<p>Of the author of the bill, Robert Toombs declared
some seven years later, with his characteristic exaggeration,
that the Apostle Paul was about his only
superior as a leader. While Alexander H. Stephens,
with absolute devotion, clung to him, until secession
swept them apart, Toombs was less faithful.
Forty-four Northern Democrats, and all but nine of
the Southern members of the House of Representatives,
supported the bill, and in the popular branch
of Congress, it prevailed, by a majority of thirteen
votes; in the Senate, by a vote of nearly three to
one.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> But Mr. Wilson declares that the Act contained
a fatal ambiguity. When was squatter sovereignty
to give its decision on the question of
slavery?</p>

<p>Here was where the break came, when the Act
was being tried out in practical operation.</p>

<p>The Southern members thought that Douglas represented
their view. Mr. Davis, Secretary of War
at the time of its introduction, distinctly declares,
that, at Douglas’s request, he obtained the interview
between Douglas’s committee and the President on
Sunday, January 22, 1854, by which the President’s
approval was secured, and he avers, that from the
terms of the bill and arguments used in its support,
he thought its purpose was to open the territory
“to the people of all the States with every
species of property recognized by any of them.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>But Douglas was not simply leading the Southern
minority. He was endeavoring to formulate a
policy by means of which he could yoke both sections
to his triumphal car, and he was just as ready
to use the Southerners, as they were to use him.
When the Southerners found out how he proposed
to over-reach them, Alexander H. Stephens still
clung to him; but Toombs, less faithful, vociferated
that he “didn’t have a leg to stand upon.”</p>

<p>The truth was, compromise upon compromise had
so involved the question, that it was almost impossible
to disentangle it without the use of the
sword.</p>

<p>In 1787 there had been a compromise, by which
slavery and the slave trade had been both recognized;
and over the Missouri question in 1820, the
Southern States had had a perfect constitutional
right to dissolve the Union; but again compromise
had been accepted.</p>

<p>The admission of California and the law of 1850
was a distinct breach of the second compromise and
the right to secede was just as clear, as it had been
in 1820; but the expediency of such action was
nothing like as clear. There was no great and
towering personality around which men could
gather. Rhett’s resolution in Congress in 1838 was
the logical result of Calhoun’s teaching since 1833;
but Calhoun was not ready to act. If ever secession
was a practical policy it was in 1838 as presented by
Rhett in Congress.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>In South Carolina in 1850, Calhoun was dead, and
there was the view of Rhett and the view of Cheves.
In Georgia there was the view of Cobb and the view
of Toombs, and the view of Hill and the view of
Stephens.</p>

<p>Of the man who did more than any other to arrest
secession in 1850, we know least, and what we
do know does not help us to any great extent to
understand him. What policy Howell Cobb represented
is not very clear. He was strong enough
to be denounced as a traitor by those who could
not drive him from their path, and somewhat in
the same way that Hayne was taken out of national
politics, when State politics required a man of unusual
force, Cobb stepped down in 1852 from the
high station of Speaker of the House of Representatives,
to become Governor of Georgia; while in
the last four years before secession, he was silenced
by his position in Buchanan’s Cabinet.</p>

<p>But apart from leaders the country had changed,
and in spite of the declarations to the contrary, in
nowhere more than in the South.</p>

<p>The continual increase of the Negro population
and the immense sums invested in that species of
property had worked a disintegration of former
views.</p>

<p>Nullification had accelerated the change, for the
views of Hayne in 1827 and Calhoun in 1836, were
certainly wide apart.</p>

<p>In 1845 Calhoun had congratulated Hammond on
the progress of opinion in the South to the high
ground he had held in advance; but it may well be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
doubted whether Calhoun, himself, would not have
been startled by the progress disclosed in 1855, as
evinced by the agitation for the re-opening of the
slave trade.</p>

<p>In 1845 when Wise, then United States Minister
to Brazil, disclosed the manner of conducting the
slave trade in that country, in which both Englishmen
and Americans were implicated, the President,
in whose cabinet Calhoun then was Secretary of
State, condemned it without stint, rejoicing that
“our own coasts are free from its pollution”; although
he was forced to admit that there were
“many circumstances to warrant the belief that
some of our citizens are deeply involved in its
guilt.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>Calhoun’s criticism of Wise on this occasion was
only that he feared he was injudicious, and that his
declarations might affect the relations between Brazil
and the United States.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Certainly Calhoun was not the man to have
favored what his chief styled “pollution,” and to
have remained in his cabinet.</p>

<p>Again, there is no reason to believe that Calhoun
sympathized at all with the ambitious scheme of
forcing slavery to the Pacific. Whatever may have
been the merits or demerits of his policies, they were
strictly defensive, and he clung almost religiously
to the phrase, “slavery as it exists in the South.”</p>

<p>What that was, to some extent was disclosed by
the committee on religious instruction of the Negroes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
which, in 1845 received reports from all
quarters of the South.</p>

<p>Robert Barnwell Rhett, was at the head of one of
the principal committees and among its members
were D. E. Huger, Basil Gildersleeve, Robert W.
Barnwell and many others prominent in affairs of
State and matters of culture and religion in the
South.</p>

<p>The account from Alabama of “the servant Ellis”
is most interesting. His blood and color, it was
claimed were unmixed, and he gave much aid in the
meetings among the Negroes, though “more retiring
and modest than most people of his condition,
when they have ability above their fellows.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>It is said he could read both Greek and Latin and
was anxious to undertake Hebrew; and the synods
of Alabama and Mississippi proposed to purchase
him, in order to send him to Africa as a Missionary.</p>

<p>Conditions such as these reports revealed were
absolutely ignored by the fanatical Abolitionists of
that day although they are but some of the many
indications how mild and humanizing slavery, as it
then existed in the South, was.</p>

<p>But the question was, could it so continue? And
by 1855 there were ominous signs of a change. Agitation
began for the re-opening of the slave trade.</p>

<p>What a frightful moral injury to the South this
would have been, is evidenced by the statement alone
of those who advocated this course, and at the same
time had the courage to express their views on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
inadequacy of the laws then in existence for the
proper protection of those of the inferior race, who
were then in the South, improved as they had been
by years of training.</p>

<p>In 1856, Governor James H. Adams, of South
Carolina, had thus expressed himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If we cannot supply the demand for slave labor, then
we must expect to be supplied with a species of labor, we
do not want, and which from the very nature of things is
antagonistic to our institutions. It is much better that our
drays should be driven by slaves—that our factories should
be worked by slaves—that our hotels should be served by
slaves—that our locomotives should be served by slaves,
than that we should be exposed to the introduction, from
any quarter, of a population alien to us by birth, training
and education, and which, in the process of time, must lead
to that conflict between capital and labor, which makes it
so difficult to maintain free institutions in all wealthy and
highly cultivated nations, where such institutions as ours do
not exist.”</p>

<p>In all slave holding States true policy dictates, that the
superior race should direct, and the inferior perform all
menial service. Competition between the white and the
black man for this service may not disturb Northern sensibility,
but it does not suit our latitude. Irrespective, however,
of interest, the Act of Congress declaring the slave
trade piracy, is a brand upon us, which I think it important
to remove. If the trade be piracy, the slave must be
plunder; and no ingenuity can avoid the logical necessity
of such conclusion.</p>

<p>My hopes and fortunes are indissolubly associated with
this form of society. I feel that I should be wanting in
duty, if I did not urge you to withdraw your assent to an
Act which is itself a direct condemnation of your institutions.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>That was the true, the honest, the intelligent and
the reasonable statement of the case; the hopes and
fortunes of those in control were indissolubly associated
with the form of society which slavery had
erected in the South.</p>

<p>In the elaborate report of the committee of the
General Assembly of South Carolina, in reply to the
message, in which the said Act was recommended to
be nullified; while the honesty and sincerity of the
members may not be questioned, their woeful unfitness
for the position of responsibility placed upon
them, has, in the light of time, been made almost
ludicrously apparent. Their utter inability to appreciate
the terrific evils, to the civilization they
thought they were defending and strengthening by
their advocacy of the re-opening of the slave trade,
was most strikingly indicated by their impressions
of the effect of emancipation, less lurid than Hammond’s
picture, but as strikingly incorrect.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The paralysis of industry, which would ensue from the
emancipation of the slaves, would, in the course of a single
year, leave the whole country almost destitute of food and
the wretched inhabitants would perish by thousands with
all the lingering tortures of unsatisfied hunger.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
</div>

<p>When to this were added the effusions of men
like Spratt, we can scarcely realize, that this was
from the State which had produced Robert Barnwell,
Joseph Alston, William Lowndes and Robert
Y. Hayne.</p>

<p>In the minority report, however, of an adopted
son, J. Johnston Pettigrew, who six years later fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
with honor and renown, high in rank, in the retreat
from Gettysburg, the State found better representation;
while the brilliant Hammond, who had averred
that he: “endorsed without reserve the much abused
sentiment of Governor McDuffie, that ‘slavery is the
corner-stone of our republican edifice’;” nevertheless
also had declared, in his controversy with Clarkson:
“I might say, that I am no more in favor of slavery
in the abstract, than I am of poverty, disease, deformity,
idiocy or any other inequality of the human
family; that I love perfection and I think I should
enjoy a millennium such as God has promised.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>It was not then that men like Hammond, Adams
and Robert G. Harper, of Georgia, were blind to the
abuses of slavery, for Adams, the advocate of the
re-opening of the slave trade, had in his message to
the General Assembly of South Carolina only the
year before declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The administration of our laws in relation to our colored
population by our Courts of magistrates and free holders,
as these Courts are at present constituted, calls loudly for
reform. Their decisions are rarely in conformity with justice
or humanity. I have felt constrained, in a majority of
the cases brought to my notice, either to modify the sentence,
or set it aside altogether.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Yet Governor Adams was willing to risk the
frightful increase of such recognized evils, by the
flooding of the South with a host of barbarians fresh
from the jungles of Africa.</p>

<p>But against this, Harper, of Georgia, was a tower
of strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>Prof. DuBois declares that “although such hot-heads
as Spratt were not able, as late as 1859, to
carry a substantial majority of the South with them,
in an attempt to reopen the trade at all hazards,
yet the agitation did succeed in sweeping away
nearly all theoretical opposition to the trade, and
left the majority of Southern people in an attitude,
which regarded the opening of the African slave
trade as merely a question of expediency.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>This he attempted to sustain by quotations from
the Charleston <cite>Standard</cite>, Richmond <cite>Examiner</cite>, New
Orleans <cite>Delta</cite>, and other Southern papers, intimating
that Johnston Pettigrew’s minority report cost
him his re-election to the Legislature of South Carolina.
As had been shown, it did not, however, stand
in the way of his elevation to a high command of the
forces South Carolina furnished for the War between
the States; while Senator Hammond, who
had risen to the highest honor his State could bestow,
declared unequivocablly in 1858, with regard
to the re-opening of the slave trade: “I once entertained
the idea myself, but on further investigation
abandoned it. I will not now go into the discussion
of it further than to say that the South is itself
divided on that policy, and from appearances, opposed
to it by a vast majority.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>James Chesnut, the other senator from South
Carolina, also announced himself publicly against
it in the same year. But it was in the profoundly
thoughtful and admirably thorough argument of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
Harper of Georgia, that the opponents of re-opening
found the best representation.</p>

<p>Southern to the core, it is a defense of slavery
“as it existed in the South,” that cannot be improved
upon.</p>

<p>Harper knew that slave labor was not by any
means cheap labor. Like Hammond and other students
of affairs, he knew that free labor was cheaper
both in Great Britain and the United States, but
that the reports of the parliamentary commission
of 1842 had indicated that the laboring classes of
the United Kingdom were in a more miserable condition,
and were more degraded morally and physically
than the slaves of the South. He realized
that capital would inevitably reach out for cheap
labor, which while a benefit to the employer and the
consumer, would slowly undermine the foundations
of the republic, bringing all labor down, while it
built up a privileged class of idle rich. He heard
in this cry for the re-opening of the slave trade, the
same demand for cheap labor with all the ills which
the South had freed herself from, in the years in
which she had trained and elevated her expensive
laboring class. He saw this cheap imported slave
labor invading the province of the remnant of the
white working class of the South, and rendering it
inimical to the institution. But above and beyond
all this, he saw the slave trade, as his forbears had
seen it in the days the South produced her strongest
men, and without any reserve he declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By the votes of Southern representatives as well as
Northern, we have stamped upon it the brand and penalty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
of the greatest of crimes against mankind.... The change
has not yet been worked in public opinion in the South. It
will be hard to produce it. When the attempt shall be made,
it will develop a division which ages of discussion will utterly
fail to overcome.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>
</div>

<p>As objectionable as slavery is in the abstract, it
is a debatable question whether Harper of Georgia,
advocate of slavery, as it existed in the South
in 1858, but determined opponent of the re-opening
of the slave trade, did not occupy higher
ground from a humanitarian standpoint, than did
Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut in 1787, who was
then, “for leaving the clause as it stands, let every
State import what it pleases.... As population increases
poor laborers will be so plenty as to render
slaves useless.”</p>

<p>Ellsworth might have gone further and declared
with truth, that, if poor laborers were not sufficiently
plenteous, they could be imported. In 1912 they
were being brought in in such swarms that our
civilization was said to be threatened thereby.</p>

<p>But while there was this pronounced opposition
to the re-opening of the slave trade in the South,
there is not much room to doubt that the slave population
of the South had been largely recruited with
illicit importations from abroad from 1808. To
what extent it is difficult to arrive at with any degree
of accuracy.</p>

<p>In his “Suppression of the Slave Trade,” Prof.
DuBois quotes Congressional documents, to indicate
that from Amelia Island, on the Gulf Coast, in 1817<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
the pirates had eleven armed vessels with which
they captured slavers, and brought their cargoes
into the United States<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and that, a year after the
capture of the island by United States troops,
African and West Indian Negroes were almost daily
illicitly introduced into Georgia.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> He also claims
that the estimates of three representatives of Congress,
Tallmadge of New York, Middleton, of South
Carolina, and Wright of Virginia, in the year 1819,
were that slaves were then being brought into the
country at the rate of about 14,000 a year.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> He
thinks while smuggling never entirely ceased, the
participation of Americans declined between 1825
and 1835, when it again revived, reaching its highest
activity between 1840 and 1860, when the city
of New York was “the principal port of the world
for this infamous commerce, although Portland and
Boston were only second.”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> He quotes DeBow for
the statement that, in 1856, forty slavers cleared annually
from Eastern harbors, clearing yearly $17,000,000,
and from the report of the American Anti-Slavery
Society, that between 1857 and 1858 twenty-one
of the twenty-two slavers seized by the British
cruisers proved to be American, from New York,
Boston and New Orleans;<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> and Stephen A. Douglas
claimed to have seen recently imported slaves
at Vicksburg and Memphis in 1859.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>The Charleston <cite>Courier</cite> in 1839 printed an extract
from the New York <cite>Journal of Commerce</cite>,
to the effect that twenty-three vessels under the
American flag had sailed about that time from
Havana on the slave trade<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. And the Charleston
<cite>Mercury</cite> in 1849 declared: “The slave trade is again
very active in Cuba.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>In support of these claims it can be said:</p>

<p>Of the increase of the colored population of the
United States from 1850 to 1860, more than one-half
was in the four States of Louisiana, Mississippi,
Arkansas and Texas, into which slaves could most
easily be imported, and the temper of the most
northerly of those was becoming extremely sensitive
upon the subject of allusions to the institution of
slavery, as the following extract of a resolution
adopted by the Legislature of that State, and sent
to the other States of the Union, indicates:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whereas the right of property in slaves is expressly
recognized by the Constitution of the United States, and is
by virtue of such recognition guaranteed against unfriendly
action on behalf of the General Government; and whereas,
each State of the Union, by the fact of being a party to the
federal compact, is also a party to the recognition and guaranty
aforesaid.... Resolved: That the citizens of the
State of Ohio have pursued a course peculiarly unjust and
odious, in their fanatical hostility to institutions for which
they are not responsible; in their encouragement of known
felons and endorsement of repeated violations of law and
decency, and in their establishment of abolition presses,
and circulation of incendiary documents, urging a servile
population to bloodshed and rapine, and by reason of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
premises, it is the duty and interest of the people of Arkansas
to discontinue all social and commercial relations with
the citizens of the said State.” etc.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is interesting to note that in his very able and
extremely interesting paper on “The Fight for the
Northwest,” 1860, the map which accompanies the
article of Prof. W. E. Dodd, does not include Ohio.</p>

<p>Quoting from a speech of Senator Hammond in
1858, in which the latter declared: “The most valuable
part of the Mississippi belongs to us, and although
those who have settled above us, are now
opposed to us, another generation will tell another
tale,”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Mr. Dodd draws from it the conclusion that
“Hammond’s idea was that the railroads connecting
the West and the South, would so stimulate reciprocal
trade between the farmers and the planters, that
the resistance of the Chicago-Detroit region would
be overcome.”</p>

<p>But it should be borne in mind that in 1858-1860,
between the West and the South there stretched a
great tract of country over six hundred miles in
length, and nearly three hundred miles in breadth,
through the whole extent of which not a single railroad
stretched across from the Potomac at Harper’s
Ferry to the junction of the Ohio River with
the Mississippi, near the northeastern corner of
Arkansas.</p>

<p>To have crossed this great stretch just about the
center at its widest part was the scheme of Hayne’s
road which had been abandoned for a scheme of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>weakly paralleling below, the network stretching
west above.</p>

<p>The effort of the presidential campaign by the
Democrats may have been for an election in the
House in 1860, and may have been lost, as Prof.
Dodd declares, “only by a narrow margin by the
votes of the foreigners, whom the railroads poured
in numbers into the contested region;” but that
triumph at the most would have only deferred the
contest for another four years, for by its special
correspondent in the West, the Columbus, Georgia,
<cite>Times</cite> had been informed in 1854:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If Kansas becomes a free soil State slavery will be
doomed for Missouri.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The attempt then, inaugurated in 1840, to parallel
the Northern systems, pouring population westward,
was recognized as an impossible task in 1860, and
with the election of Lincoln, known as the man who
had declared a house divided against itself cannot
stand, the South attempted to end the division by
Secession.</p>

<p>To such a solution the more powerful North was
unwilling to consent, and the war followed for the
Union.</p>

</div>


<p>From a consideration of the wisdom, propriety
and morality of importing African slaves as an article
of commerce in 1787, the Negro Question in the
United States had progressed to the wisdom and
propriety of preventing any extension of the institution
of slavery beyond those limits in which it
existed in 1820, and from this, with repeated agitations,
fairly shaking the Union to its foundation,
followed by compromises satisfactory to none, there
had flared up a consideration of the re-opening of the
Slave Trade in 1856, swiftly followed by Secession
and war in 1860, and Emancipation, as a war measure,
in 1863, directed against the eleven Confederate
States.</p>

<p>Throughout the four years of desperate struggle
between the seceding States and the consolidated
Northern and Western States, the slaves, by their
behavior, illustrated moral character greatly to their
credit, and indisputably indicative of the civilizing
influences of the institution, in which they had been
trained. But peace in 1865 at once precipitated the
question of the status of the freedman. In the
Northern States it was an important question. In
the Southern States it beggared all other questions.</p>

<p>With a property loss running up into the billions
and a loss in virile manhood almost incalculable and
an indescribable uprooting and overturning of industrial
conditions, the failure of Secession left the
eleven States, which had constituted the Southern
Confederacy, with a white population of about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
5,000,000, and a colored population of about 4,000,000;
but in three of them, South Carolina, Mississippi
and Louisiana the colored population exceeded
the white.</p>

<p>Was the forecast of Calhoun and de Tocqueville to
be verified?</p>

<p>In no States was the outlook as dark as in South
Carolina, where there could hardly have been more
than 250,000 whites to 400,000 Negroes, and in
Mississippi, where the colored majority was not quite
so large, the proportions there being 350,000 white
to some 430,000 Negroes. Yet of the colored population
in South Carolina, judging from the number
of free persons of color, in 1860, some 9,914,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> and
the number of house slaves and mechanics in
Charleston returned for taxation in 1859,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> in the
great mass, there were those of the Negroes, who,
on account of training, education and environment,
together with inherited tradition, if they had only
been left unplayed upon by those who knew them
not, might have been relied upon in any great
emergency. These, at an estimate, might have
amounted to 30,000 in South Carolina; in Mississippi,
less.</p>

<p>In both of these States, therefore, an earnest,
thoughtful attempt was designed by the former ruling
class of whites, to rebuild the political structure,
at the same time readjusting the Negroes to the
changed condition brought about by emancipation.
But, before considering this much berated effort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
the vanquished, a short sketch of conditions in South
Carolina in the spring and summer of 1865 will
show to some extent the increasing complexities and
difficulties of the problem, which Lincoln’s death
saved him from, and which Andrew Johnson had to
face.</p>

<p>Even before Lincoln’s assassination there was
evidence of a strong disposition, upon the part of
the pronounced abolitionists, to humiliate the overthrown,
and, in particular, that State and city which
for three decades had led the fight for “Slavery as
we know it in the Southern States.”</p>

<p>On April 6, 1865, William Lloyd Garrison,
United States Senator Henry Wilson, of Massachusetts,
Judge Kelly of Pennsylvania, Theodore Tilton
and his intimate friend Rev. Henry Ward Beecher of
New York, with George Thompson of England,
visited Charleston.</p>

<p>By General Saxton of Massachusetts, they were
personally conducted to the Citadel Green on Calhoun
Street, a circumstance calling for some facetious
remarks by Major Delany, a very remarkable
colored member of the General’s Staff, and there
the general presented the great abolitionist to the
immense throng that had gathered to hear him.
But, as thoroughly as the general and his distinguished
guests considered that they understood conditions,
it is possible, they were slightly surprised by
the aplomb with which Samuel J. Dickerson (as a
slave a bricklayer, but as a local freedman, dropping
his tools for a higher pursuit and destined to become
the mountebank of the bar) thrust himself and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
two daughters into the very centre of the picture.
In a fluent speech, Dickerson presented Garrison
with a wreath. The great man complimented him
in his reply, exalted the State of Massachusetts and
himself introduced Senator Wilson, as one of the
“mudsills” of Massachusetts, who had from such
condition risen to the eminence he had attained.
Then the great abolitionist gave way to the Senator,
who proclaimed the occasion “the proudest day
of his life.”</p>

<p>Shouting to the excitable throng before him that
he felt “the slave power under his heel” he bellowed
out his sentiments as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I want the proud and haughty chivalry of South Carolina
to know ... that the black men and black women of South
Carolina are as free as they are.... And further that they
are loyal to the flag of the country, while they are false
and traitorous.... We have beaten; we have whipped them;
their power is broken and they are lost forever.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He was followed by Judge Kelly, who denounced
ex-President Buchanan and eulogized Sam Dickerson.
Other speeches followed in a similar vein and
to such an extent did the orgy of oratory extend
that the apparently one sane member of the band
felt himself impelled upon the occasion of a later
address delivered at Zion Church to warn the Negroes
against—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“their remaining enemies, pride, indolence, impertinence;
they are the serpents which will tempt the people.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The war was not as yet absolutely over and this
speech of Senator Wilson’s widely advertised must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
have rendered many Confederate officers desperate.
Don C. Seitz in his very valuable volume, “Braxton
Bragg, General of the Confederacy” gives a most
interesting letter from Wade Hampton, not a fortnight
later, to Jefferson Davis, arguing against acceptance
of the terms of General Sherman to General
Johnston, in which he pictures most effectively the
conditions worse than war, which were foreshadowed
by surrender. But fierce as was the blaze that
Wilson and his like were fanning, it became a devouring
flame with the assassination of Lincoln.
This President Johnson, with the aid of Seward,
strove earnestly to quench.</p>

<p>Born in North Carolina, the most democratic
State of the old South, Andrew Johnson had raised
himself from the humblest of origins to a position
of distinct prominence in that western Southern
State Tennessee, mainly peopled from North Carolina.
Having been governor of and senator from
Tennessee, he had been placed in the dangerous office
of war governor in that State at a time, when
through it echoed and reëchoed the continual tramp
of opposing armies, as they reeled back and forward
in contests rivalling those which soaked the soil of
Virginia with blood.</p>

<p>With nothing of the personal magnetism or the
attractive traits of his predecessor, the great rail
splitter and wrestler of the West; immovable to
every suggestion that he should purchase support
with prostitution of the appointing power, even for
a good end; giving out his sentiments with an aggressive
honesty, which must have shocked the careless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
average; nothing could have more clearly
marked the gulf between him and the sentimentality
of the abolitionists, Garrison, Davis, Kelly and
others, than his reception in the very first days of
his presidency of the delegation of colored men who
called upon him chiefly to indulge in that, to them
the dearest right of freedom, free speech. To these
and to the general public of the North, his reply
must have been offensive, whatever truth it may
have contained. He said in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is easy in Congress and from the pulpit, North and
South to talk about polygamy and Brigham Young and debauchery
of various kinds; but there is also one great fact
that four millions of people lived in open and notorious
concubinage. The time has come when you must correct
this thing. You know what I say is true and you must do
something to correct it by example as well as words and
professions.... I trust in God the time may come when
you shall be gathered together in a clime and country
suited to you, should it be found that the two races cannot
get along together.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is almost idle, after the above, to state that
Johnson was absolutely devoid of the kindly tact and
vulgar humor, which had so endeared Lincoln, the
supplest politician of his time, to the coarse mass of
the electorate, as he had voiced for it, its thoughts
in a tongue it could understand and appreciate.</p>

<p>When we reflect, that Johnson, a Southern man,
the Vice President coming from the conquered South,
was handed the reins at the moment when the victorious
North, flushed with conquest, saw its great
leader, identified with the West, hurled from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
high position to bloody death, at the hands of a
murderer, who proclaimed his sympathy with the
vanquished South, the immensity of the difficulties
about to confront him begins to appear. In
addition, he, himself, before being steadied by the
responsibilities of the office, had “breathed threatenings
and slaughter.”</p>

<p>In a proclamation, claiming that Jefferson Davis
and others had incited, concocted and procured the
atrocious murder of President Abraham Lincoln
and the attempted assassination of William H.
Seward, ex-President Jefferson Davis had been held
up to obloquy and, upon his capture, imprisoned
and chained; but what was infinitely more horrible,
Wirz, the Confederate officer in charge of Andersonville,
was made a human sacrifice, under circumstances
which have left an ineffaceable blot upon all
in any way responsible for making him the scapegoat
for the very effective military policy which
refused the Confederate offer to exchange prisoners.
If it took the magnanimity and fortitude of Seward
to point out the method by which the Union might
be saved from the fate in which the Congressional
conspirators meant to involve it, for their own immediate
ends, and if, in this hacked victim of the assassins,
Johnson found the anchor by which he rode
out the storm which burst upon him; yet it should
be remembered that nothing but the sturdiest integrity
and most indomitable courage could have
nerved Johnson to even attempt the struggle, he
fought out to the end. Conditions in the South were
appalling. Bled to a whiteness, which not even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
France experienced in the Great War; with her
labor system hopelessly disorganized by the Freedman’s
Bureau; not only by its methods but by the
openly announced suggestions of its head, General
Howard, that the landholders should be compelled by
the Federal Government to furnish their former
slaves with land,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> industry stood still. With Negro
troops quartered in every direction under “the deliberate
purpose to emphasize the completeness of the
catastrophe which the war had brought upon the
South,”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> collisions between them and the whites
were of almost daily occurrence. But these could not,
in the bulk of cases, be attributed to the truculence of
Southern slave holders from the fact that instances
were not few, in which Northern troops, acting in
the line of duty, were assailed by colored men. A
Federal soldier, acting as guard and on his post at
a house in Abbeville, was shot by colored soldiers,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
incensed against the inmates. Sergeant Terry and
four members of the 127th New York Volunteers,
acting as a guard on the Battery at Charleston, were
set upon by Negroes abetted by members of the 35th
United States Colored Troops and two of the guard
wounded, before the arrival of additional white
troops scattered the assailants with five casualties
and some arrests.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Later, Lieutenant A. S. Bodine,
of the same regiment, for clearing a meeting of
whites of uninvited Negroes, among whom appeared
Negro soldiers with sidearms, was courtmartialed
by order of General Hatch in command at Charleston,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the court finding him guilty, on the flimsiest
evidence, of “unwarrantable exercise of arbitrary
power” and sentencing him to reprimand by his
superior officer, which reprimand was immediately
ordered to be withdrawn by the general in command
of the department.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>With such conditions in towns and cities it is
scarcely surprising to read the account of the execution
a little later of James Grippen and Ben Redding
of Co. F, 104th United States Colored Troops,
on charges of rape, arson and burglary, they with
others, not apprehended, having broken into a house
near McPhersonville, South Carolina, and there
ravished four white women, named.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> With such
facts leaking out from time to time, in spite of the
pressure from outside of his cabinet to induce him
to leave South Carolina for a couple of years under
military rule, President Johnson determined to appoint
a provisional governor and, for this purpose,
issued a proclamation which was in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whereas the 4th section of the 4th article of the Constitution
of the United States declares that the United
States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a republican
form of government and shall protect each of them
against invasion and domestic violence; and whereas the
President of the United States is by the Constitution made
Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy as well as chief
civil executive officer of the United States, and is bound by
solemn oath faithfully to execute the office of President of
the United States and to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed; and whereas the rebellion which has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
waged by a portion of the people of the United States against
the properly constituted authorities of the Government thereof
in the most violent and revolting form, but whose organized
and armed forces have been almost entirely overcome,
has in its revolutionary progress, deprived the people of
the State of South Carolina of all civil government; and
whereas it becomes necessary and proper to carry out and
enforce the obligations of the United States to the people of
South Carolina in securing them in the enjoyment of a republican
form of government. Now therefore, in obedience
to the high and solemn duties imposed upon me by the
Constitution of the United States, and for the purpose of
enabling the loyal people of said State to organize a State
Government, whereby justice may be established, domestic
tranquillity insured and loyal citizens protected in all their
rights of life, liberty and property, I, Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of
the army and navy of the United States do hereby appoint
Benjamin F. Perry of South Carolina, Provisional Governor
of the State of South Carolina, whose duty it shall be at
the earliest practicable time to prescribe such regulations
as may be necessary and proper for convening a Convention
composed of delegates to be chosen by that portion of the
people of said State who are loyal to the United States and
no others, for the purpose of altering or amending the
Constitution thereof and with authority to exercise within
the limits of said State all the powers necessary and proper
to enable such loyal people of the State of South Carolina
to restore said State to its constitutional relation to the
Federal Government and to present such a republican form
of State Government as will entitle the State to the guarantee
therefor and its people to the protection of the United States
against invasion, insurrection and domestic violence; provided
that in any election that may hereafter be held for
choosing delegates to any State Convention as aforesaid, no
person shall be qualified as an elector or shall be eligible
as a member of such convention unless he shall have previously
taken and subscribed the oath of amnesty as set
forth in the President’s proclamation, May 29th, 1865 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
is a voter as prescribed by the Constitution or laws of the
State of South Carolina in force immediately before the
date of the so called Ordinance of Secession. And the said
convention which convenes, or the Legislature that may
thereafter be assembled will prescribe the qualifications of
electors and the eligibility of persons to hold office under the
Constitution and laws of the State, as or may the people of
the several States composing the Federal Union have rightfully
exercised from the origin of the Government to the
present time. And I do hereby direct, etc.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the proclamation appeared the command that
the military authorities should in no way obstruct,
hinder or interfere with the above.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Just previously
to Governor Perry’s proclamation calling such convention,
a letter appeared contributing greatly to
the success of the President’s plan in South Carolina.
The writer of the letter was Wade Hampton,
late Lieutenant General, C.S.A. The letter reveals
the despairing condition of many, in its attempt to
assuage such. It was widely reproduced and ran
thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the editor of the Columbia Phoenix, Sir:</p>

<p>Numerous communications having been addressed to me,
proposing to form a colony to emigrate, I take this method
of answering them, not only on account of their number but
because of the want of all mail facilities. The desire to
leave a country which has been reduced to such a deplorable
condition as ours and whose future has so little of hope
is doubtless as widespread as it is natural. But I doubt the
propriety of this expatriation of so many of our best men.
The very fact that our State is passing through so terrible
an ordeal as the present should cause her sons to cling
the more closely to her. My advice to all of my fellow
citizens is that they should devote their whole energies to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the restoration of law and order, the reestablishment of agriculture
and commerce, the promotion of education and the
rebuilding of our cities and dwellings which have been laid
in ashes. To accomplish these objects, the highest that
patriotism can conceive, I recommend that all, who can do
so should take the oath of allegiance to the United States
Government, so that they may participate in the restoration
of Civil Government to our State. War, after four years
of heroic but unsuccessful struggle has failed to secure to
us the rights for which we engaged in it. To save any of
our rights—to rescue anything more from the general ruin—will
require all the statesmanship and all the patriotism
of our citizens. If the best men of our country—those who
for years past have risked their lives in her defence—refuse
to take the oath, they will be excluded from the councils of
the State, and its destiny will be committed of necessity to
those who forsook her in her hour of need or to those who
would gladly pull her down to irretrievable ruin. To guard
against such a calamity, let all true patriots devote themselves
with zeal and honesty of purpose to the restoration
of law, the blessings of peace and the rescue of whatever
liberty may be saved from the general wreck. If, after an
honest effort to effect that object, we fail we can then seek
a home in another country. A distinguished citizen of our
State—an honest man and true patriot—has been appointed
Governor. He will soon call a Convention of the people which
will be charged with the most vital interests of our State.
Choose for this Convention your best and truest men; not
those who have skulked in the hour of danger—nor those
who have worshipped Mammon, while their country was
bleeding at every pore—nor the politicians, who after urging
war dared not encounter its hardships, but those who
laid their all upon the altar of their country. Select such
men and make them serve as your representatives. You
will then be sure that your rights will not be wantonly
sacrificed, nor your liberty bartered for a mess of pottage.
My intention is to pursue this course. I recommend it to
others. Besides the obligations I owe to my State, there are
others of a personal character, which will not permit me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
to leave the country at present. I shall devote myself
earnestly, if allowed to do so, to the discharge of these obligations,
public and private. In the meantime I shall obtain
all information which would be desirable in the establishment
of a colony, in case we should be ultimately forced to
leave the country. I invoke my fellow citizens, especially
those who have shared with me the perils and the glories
of the last four years, to stand by our State manfully and
truly. The Roman Senate voted thanks to one of their
generals, because in the darkest hour of the Republic, he did
not despair. Let us emulate the example of the Romans
and thus entitle ourselves to the gratitude of our country.</p>

Wade Hampton.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>
<p class="no-indent">
July 27, 1865.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The convention was held and following it an election
for governor and members of the General Assembly
under the new Constitution and the most distinguished
members of the convention, without regard
to differences of opinion as to policies, united
in recommending as candidate for governor Hon.
James L. Orr, who prior to the war had been Speaker
of the United States House of Representatives and
with the organization of the Confederate States, a
Senator from South Carolina and who had organized
a command and seen service in the War between the
States.</p>

<p>Despite these facts and in the teeth of his published
declination of a nomination, in his absence,
General Hampton was nominated for governor by
the mechanics of Charleston and only defeated by
733 votes in a total of 19,113 cast, a vote measured
by the white males of voting age just after the war<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
and its disabilities, which must have been at least
forty per cent of what could have possibly been
polled.</p>

<p>A legislature most representative of the State assembled
and from the names appended to the: “Act
preliminary to the legislation induced by the emancipation
of slaves,” passed Nov. 19, 1865, W. D.
Porter, President of the Senate, C. H. Simonton,
Speaker of the House, and James L. Orr, Governor,
appear officially responsible for the legislation; but
the main work of framing it was done by D. L.
Wardlaw and Armistead Burt. Although continuously
and often very incorrectly assailed, viewed by
a critic in no way partial to the South, these efforts
of the vanquished, before the flood of Reconstruction
was let loose by Congress upon the South, do
not appear as frightful as they still are alleged to be.</p>

<p>Professor Burgess, speaks of them in general in
the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When the newly reorganized States came to assume
jurisdiction over matters concerning the freedmen, they
found themselves driven to some legislation to prevent the
whole Negro race from becoming paupers and criminals.
It was in the face of such a situation that the legislatures
of these States passed laws concerning apprenticeship, vagrancy
and civil rights which were looked upon at the North
as attempts to reenslave the newly emancipated and served
to bring the new State governments at the South into deep
reproach. It must be remembered, however, that at the time
of the passage of the Stevens resolution by the House of
Representatives, only two of Mr. Johnson’s reconstructed
States had passed any laws upon these subjects. These two
were Mississippi and South Carolina, and a close examination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
of the text of these enactments will hardly justify the interpretation
placed upon them by the Radical Republicans.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Professor Dunning in a later work states that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“South Carolina forbade persons of color to engage in any
trade or business other than husbandry and farm or domestic
service, except under a license requiring a substantial annual
fee; and in the code concerning master and servants
embodied many rules that strongly suggested those formerly
in force as to master and slave.”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The license required for a shopkeeper was substantial,
also that for a pedlar. It was one hundred
dollars a year. In both of these vocations the mass
of the Negroes could be easily fleeced by the shrewd
and unscrupulous members of the race; but in all
other vocations, except those free, it was only ten
dollars.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>While accusing Wilson, Sumner and other extremists
of distorting the spirit and purpose of both
the laws and the lawmakers of the South, Professor
Dunning says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Yet as a matter of fact, this legislation, far from embodying
any spirit of defiance towards the North or any
purpose to evade the conditions which the victors had imposed,
was, in the main, a conscientious and straightforward
attempt to bring some sort of order out of social and economic
chaos which a full acceptance of the war and emancipation
involved.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In his opinion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After all, the greatest fault of the Southern lawmakers
was not that their procedure was unwise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i>, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
when legislating as a conquered people, they failed adequately
to consider and be guided by the prejudices of their conquerors.”<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If there is ground for condemnation in the above,
the South must be condemned for thinking better
of their conquerors than they deserved. The South
Carolina Act, above alluded to, excepted from the
provisions of what has been called the “Black Code”—“every
person who may have of Caucasian blood,
seven-eighths or more,” who it provided “shall be
deemed a white person,”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> declaring, however, that:
“all other free Negroes, mulattoes and mestizos, all
freed women and all descendants through either sex
of any of these, except as above, shall be known as
persons of color.”</p>

<p>It declared that the statutes and regulations concerning
slaves were inapplicable to persons of color
and although such were not entitled to social or political
equality with white persons, they were given
the right to own and dispose of property, to make
contracts, to enjoy the fruits of their labor, to sue
and be sued, and to receive protection under the law
in their persons and property.</p>

<p>While the Black Code did therefore regulate the
relations and restrain persons of color, in Mr. Dunning’s
and Mr. Burgess’s opinion, there was little
in the South Carolina Act calculated to arouse any
pronounced hostility in the North. In the opinion of
the latter, indeed, it—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“provided for substantial equality in civil rights between
persons of color and white persons.”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Two provisions it did contain of great importance,
which it must be borne in mind were framed by the
representatives of 250,000 whites surrounded by
400,000 Negroes, ninety per cent of whom were
densely ignorant. The first of these was aimed to
prevent the burden of this helpless ignorance from
increasing; the second to secure to this population
a measure of protection, which those who had emancipated
the slaves had not granted to the freedmen
in their own section, by their own laws, for the
greater part of the time of their living in Free
States.—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“XXII. No person of color shall migrate into and reside
in this State, unless within twenty days after his arrival
within the same he shall enter into bond with two freeholders
as sureties to be approved by the Judge of the
District Court or a Magistrate, in a penalty of one thousand
dollars conditioned for his good behavior and for his support
if he should become unable to support himself.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This act further provided that upon failure to
furnish bond the free person of color could be
ordered to leave the State, and, upon failure to leave,
be subjected to corporal punishment within a certain
time, and if still contumacious, could be imprisoned
in the State Penitentiary for a period. The
other act granted to the immense black majority
what the laws of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, for
almost half a century, had denied to the feeble
minority of free blacks who had entered their
borders:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In every case civil and criminal in which a person of
color is a party or which affects the person or property of
a person of color, persons of color shall be competent witnesses.”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In its day and since, this legislation has been
roundly denounced. Those in control of Federal
politics saw in it a peaceful settlement of great
questions which threatened their supremacy, and
bitterly and unreservedly reprobated it, stirring up
public opinion in that section, which yet flushed with
its conquest, was unwilling to permit any interference
with its great mission of “putting the bottom
rail on top.”</p>

<p>The conquerors had preserved the Union and
abolished slavery. Those were two immense
achievements, even if ruthlessly attained.</p>

<p>As terrible as was the price which the South paid
for the abolition of slavery, it was not too great,
taking all things into consideration; and the manner
of the abolition was such, also, that in time it
must have given rise to as it did eventually produce,
that mutual respect between the sections which had
not before existed.</p>

<p>While Emancipation, being confiscation of property
without due process of law, can never be legally
justified, and only can be excused as a war measure,
yet, if the Southern people, white and black, could
only be made to see conditions as they are now in
the South and to realize that posterity does fairly
demand some consideration from those who bring
it into being, one hundred years will not have passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
before it will have been incontrovertibly demonstrated
that Emancipation was more beneficial to
the South than to the North. This statement is
made with a full appreciation of the fact that the
War, Emancipation and Reconstruction so reduced
the South and checked its industrial development,
that thirty years were required from the inception
of the War to bring that section again up to the
position it had reached in 1860, in point of wealth
and industry.</p>

<p>War and Emancipation can therefore be excused,
but Reconstruction will ever remain an ineffaceable
stain upon the conquerors. Yet, as an emetic sometimes
produces good which nothing else can bring
about, so Reconstruction may in time be shown to
have been not without its good.</p>

<p>Just what might have been the effects of the attempt
made by the Southern States to readjust the
Negroes to the changed conditions of 1865 must
now always remain a matter of surmise; for the
differentiations of color, race and condition, which
they attempted then to establish, were ruthlessly
swept out of existence by military control and universal
suffrage followed by the Civil Rights Bill.</p>

<p>But before considering that era of frantic sentimentality
concerning the African people in the
United States, the period of Congressional Reconstruction,
a little more light should be thrown upon
the struggle made by the surviving soldiery of the
Confederacy, led by Wade Hampton of South Carolina
and others less well remembered, as Wright of
Georgia, to support the policy of Seward and President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Johnson. Not unnaturally in so doing attention
will be concentrated to a very great degree
upon the Scape Goat, The Hot Bed of Secession,
The Prostrate State, although it was from without,
if upon her borders, the record was preserved by one
of her sons, an almost forgotten soldier and scholar
of the Old South, in his tireless, patriotic and absolutely
sincere and highly intelligent effort to mentally
avert the overthrow of the remnants of Southern
civilization, threatened in the advance of the
black horde of freedmen marching to plunder,
under the leadership of Sumner, Stevens and Wilson
and the half averted countenance of Grant.</p>

<p>This description by a Southern man may seem
possibly too comprehensive and severe, until we
read the declaration of that American Negro most
generally esteemed in the North in his day, the
leader of the Negro race in America:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I felt that the Reconstruction policy, so far as it related
to my race was in a large measure on a false foundation,
was artificial and forced. In many cases it seemed to me
that the ignorance of my race was being used as a tool with
which to help white men into office and that there was an
element in the North which wanted to punish the Southern
white men by forcing the Negro into positions over the heads
of Southern whites.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>
</div>

<p>How can the characterization be doubted when
we remember Senator Wilson’s speech in Charleston
and the fact that with such a record as he had
and such a field to choose from, he was made Grant’s
running mate, the Aaron for that Moses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>The Southerner who preserved this record of the
aspirations of the Old South was so identified with
the political thought of the great State of North
Carolina, that, like Andrew Jackson, whom he knew
and asserted to be a South Carolinian, he also, though
such, was thought to be a North Carolinian. But
Daniel Harvey Hill was, on July 12, 1821, born in
South Carolina, at Hill’s Iron Works, an iron manufacturing
establishment founded in the New Acquisition
(later York District), by his grandfather,
prior to the Revolutionary War, where cannon were
forged for the American army. A graduate of
West Point and a distinguished veteran of the Mexican
War, in which he rose to the brevet of Major,
he resigned from the United States army to embrace
the highest avocation a man may follow
and became in 1849 a professor of mathematics at
Washington College, Lexington, “the Athens” of Virginia,
and later, was put in control of the Military
Institute of North Carolina; whence he entered the
Confederate Army, served through the war with distinction,
rising to the rank of lieutenant general,
and issuing from Charlotte, May, 1866, the first
number of the monthly magazine, <cite>The Land We
Love</cite>, published by him from that place until April,
1869, through which he voiced the aspirations, hopes
and resolves, in the main, of the disbanded forces
of the Confederacy, probably, at that date constituting
seventy per cent or more of the white manhood
of the South. If the magazine was modeled upon
an English rather than an American type, it was
the more representative of the South Atlantic States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
at that time. If forty per cent or more of its contents
bore upon the recent war, considering the
times and the conditions of the section upon which
it was dependent for support, that was most natural.</p>

<p>In it can be found not infrequent contributions
from that Georgian said by Professor Trent to have
been the one poet the War produced from the South;
also some papers from that novelist of South Carolina
whom Lewisohn has mentioned in his article
on South Carolina, in <cite>The Nation</cite> in 1922; and one
from that Northern adopted son of South Carolina,
to whom the State owes the great institution, Clemson
College, for the aims of which General Hill
strove so hard in his opening article on “Education.”
Space will not admit of more than three extracts;
the discussion by General Hill of education; an allusion
to E. G. Lee’s “Maximilian and His Empire,”
and a still briefer allusion to and endorsement
of Wade Hampton and his policy concerning the
freedmen. The first is the most important. After
discussing the number of presidents from the South,
including Lincoln and Johnson, eleven out of the
seventeen, up to that time elected, coming from the
South and an even greater proportion of secretaries
of state and attorney generals, General Hill indicates,
that when business ability was desired, as in
the offices of secretary of the treasury and postmaster
general, the situation was at once reversed,
and thus proceeds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The facts and figures above have been given in warning,
not in boastfulness. The pride which we might have felt
in the glories of the past is rebuked by the thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
they were purchased at the expense of the material prosperity
of the country; for men of wealth and talents did not
combine their fortunes, their energies and their intellects to
develop the immense resources of the land of their nativity.
What factories did they erect? What mines did they dig?
What foundries did they establish? What machine shops
did they build? What ships did they put afloat? Their
minds and their hearts were engrossed in the struggle for
national position and national honors. The yearning desire
was for political supremacy and never for domestic thrift
and economy. Hence we became dependent upon the North
for everything from a lucifer match to a columbiad, from a
pin to a railroad engine. A state of war found us without
the machinery to make a single percussion cap for a soldier’s
rifle, or a single button for his jacket. The system
of labor which erected a class covetous of political distinction
has been forever abolished; but the system of education
based upon it is still unchanged and unmodified....
The old method of instruction was never wise; it is now
worse than folly—’tis absolute madness. Is not attention
to our fields and firesides of infinitely more importance to
us than attention to national affairs? Is not a practical
acquaintance with the ax, the plane, the saw, the anvil,
the loom, the plow and the mattock vastly more useful to
an impoverished people, than familiarity with the laws of
nations and the science of government?... All unconscious
of it though most of us may be, a kind providence is working
in the right way for the land we love. As a people we
specially needed two things. We needed the cutting off the
temptation to seek political supremacy, in order that our
common school, academic and collegiate training should be
directed to practical ends.... The state of probation, pupilage,
vassalage, or whatever it may be called in which we
have been placed by the dominant party in Congress is we
believe intended by the Giver of every good and perfect
gift to give us higher and nobler ideas of education and the
duties of educated men.... Again we needed to have manual
labor made honorable. And here a kind Providence has
brought good out of evil.... God is now honoring manual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
labor with us, as he has never done with any other nation.
It is the high born, the cultivated, the intelligent, the brave,
the generous, who are now constrained to work with their
own hands. Labor is thus associated in our minds with all
that is honorable in birth, refined in manners, bright in
intellect, manly in character and magnanimous in soul....
Now that labor has been dignified and cherished we want it
to be recognized in our schools and colleges.... The peasant
who would confine the teachings of his son to Machiavelli’s
Discourse ‘On the Prince’ or Fenelon’s ‘instruction to his
royal pupils,’ would be no more ignoring his rank and station
than are our teachers ignoring the condition of the
country. Is the law of nations important to us who constitute
nor state, nor colony, nor territory? Is the science of
mind useful to us just now, when our highest duty is to
mind our own business? Will logic help us in our reasoning
whether we are in or out of the Union? Will the flowers
of rhetoric plant any roses in our burnt districts?...
We want on the contrary a comprehensive plan of instruction,
which will embrace the useful rather than the
profound, the practical rather than the theoretic; a system
which will take up the ignorant in his degredation, enlighten
his mind, cultivate his heart, and fit him for the
solemn duties of an immortal being; a system which will
come to the poor in his poverty and instruct him in the
best method of procuring food, raiment and the necessaries
of life; a system which will give happiness to the many, and
not aggrandizement to the few, a system which will foster
and develop mechanical ingenuity and relieve labor of its
burden; which will entwine its laurel wreath around the
brow of honest industry and frown with contempt upon
the idle and worthless.”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Is it surprising that a man who thus exhorted the
South in that day and hour should have been condemned
by both Sumner of Massachusetts and Pollard
of Virginia?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>For three years, the worst in the history of the
South, he kept his magazine before the people of
South with a circulation of 12,000 copies and agents
in every Southern State and in addition in New
York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and California. He
never gave up the fight and in the year of his death
saw his dream come true, but he did not get that
support his cause would have entitled him to particularly
expect from the then leading port of the
South Atlantic. For even a devoted citizen of
Charleston must admit, that Charleston, by such evidences
as exist, was rather cold to this voice of the
South. For a few months Burke and Boinest were
the agents in that city, then no names appear as
representatives in the greatest city of the South,
with the exception of New Orleans; while, at
little places in South Carolina, Mayesville, Edgefield,
Society Hill and Kingstree, the agents held on
to the end, faithful unto death. But in Charleston,
within one month from the suspension of <cite>The Land
We Love</cite>, a new Southern magazine was launched,
<cite>The XIX Century</cite>, edited by F. G. DeFontaine, distinctly
lighter, and, as events indicated, with less
lasting power.</p>

<p>Returning to General Hill’s magazine, if manual
and industrial training was a hobby and if his criticism
of the former political training and lack of
industrial enterprise was too sweeping; yet in his
columns was afforded space for the most interesting
illustration of what that political training could
flower into, which can be found anywhere in the
printed page in the United States. This is a sweeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
statement itself; but if the highest type of cultivated
diplomat, thoroughly conversant with the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haute politique</i> will read and ponder “Maximilian
and His Empire” contributed by Gen. E. G. Lee, Feb.
1867, he would be curious to know who this Gen.
E. G. Lee was and what were his opportunities for
gathering the political knowledge which appears
most interestingly spread with something of the assurance
of a political seer, as time has shown.</p>

<p>E. G. Lee was a Virginian, only a brigadier.
Born at Leeland, May 25, 1835, a graduate of William
and Mary College, he served under Stonewall
Jackson in the Valley campaign. Forced by ill
health to withdraw from military service between
1863 and 1864, he was, in the latter part of the
last mentioned year, sent to Canada on secret service
for the Confederate Government, just about the
time at which Blair approached the officials of the
Confederacy, according to Alex. H. Stephens, Vice
President of the Confederacy, aiming to bring
about—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“a secret military convention between the belligerents with
a view of preventing the establishment of a French Empire
in Mexico by the joint operation of the Federal and Confederate
armies in maintenance of the Monroe Doctrine.
In this way (writes Mr. Stephens) Mr. Blair thought, as
Mr. Davis stated to me, a fraternization would take place
between the two armies and peace be ultimately obtained by
a restoration of the Union without the subjugation of the
Southern States.”<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>In his Lincoln, Mr. Stephenson says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While the amendment (abolishing slavery) was taking
its way through Congress, a shrewd old politician who
thought he knew the world better than most men, that
Montgomery Blair, Senior, who was father to the Postmaster
General, had been trying on his own responsibility to
open negotiations between Washington and Richmond. His
visionary ideas, which were wholly without the results he
intended have no place here. And yet this fanciful episode
had a significance of its own. Had it not occurred, the Confederate
Government probably would not have appointed
commissioners charged with the hopeless task of approaching
the Federal Government for the purpose of negotiating peace
between ‘the two countries.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Just what was really happening in the world of
politics in these dying days of the Confederacy may
possibly never be known with any degree of exactness.
The play of politics, not only in the United
States; but around the world was quick and varied
but very obscure. Mr. Stephenson, the most interesting
and thoughtful observer of Lincoln’s career
attaches very slight importance to Blair’s negotiations
with the Confederacy; but more to the prior
negotiations of Gilmore and Jacquess, even going so
far as to assert, on the authority of Nicolay and Hay,
that Davis had said in his interview with them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You have already emancipated nearly two millions of our
slaves; and if you will take care of them, you may emancipate
the rest. I had a few when the war began. I was of
some use to them; they never were of any to me.”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Nicolay and Hay do assert that Jacquess asserted
that Davis so stated; but they also give Davis’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
account of the incident which he published in his
“Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government.”
In this we find no such assertion by Davis and on
the contrary the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Gilmore addressed me and in a few minutes conveyed
the information that the two gentlemen had come
to Richmond impressed with the idea that the Confederate
Government would accept a peace on the basis of a reconstruction
of the Union, the abolition of slavery and the grant
of an amnesty to the people of the States as repentant criminals....
The impudence of the remarks could only be
extenuated because of the ignorance displayed and the profuse
avowal of the kindest motives and intentions.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>
</div>

<p>From this Mr. Davis proceeds to discuss the appointment
of commissioners to Canada about the
middle of 1864, their failure and the mission of Mr.
Blair in December. Gen. E. G. Lee’s name is not
among the commissioners, as stated, nor is there any
reference to his mission in <cite>The Rise and Fall</cite>. But
his article in <cite>The Land We Love</cite><a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> appearing in 1867
shows a knowledge and understanding of politics
enveloping “Maximilian and His Empire,” viewed
from the standpoint of the Confederate States, Louis
Napoleon, and Wm. H. Seward, most interesting.
This forgotten and youthful Virginian graduate of
the oldest college in the United States, in the discussion
of a matter in which he does not mention
himself, must have had sources of information,
which he does not reveal. His admiration for an
opponent, Seward, is unrestrained. His contempt
for Louis Napoleon is expressed with a refinement
that imparts to it a greater force; and altogether as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
he passes from the stage an unreconstructed “Rebel,”
dying even before Virginia shook off the grip of the
blacks, he carries with him to the grave some history,
which if more fully revealed might have added
interest to Blair’s mission. At all events, if General
Hill asked—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Is not attention to our fields and firesides of infinitely
more importance to us than attention to national affairs?”<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">he yielded space and advanced to the front page of
his magazine one best fitted to illustrate—“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Audi
alteram partem</i>.”</p>

<p>A little later in an editorial praising Generals
Hampton and Wright, Hill says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So far as we have been able to ascertain every Southern
newspaper edited by a Confederate soldier, has followed the
lead of these distinguished officers. The prominent idea
held out by Generals Hampton and Wright, is that the
freedman is to be trained to feel that he is a Southern man,
identified with the South in its interests, its trials and its
suffering. He is to be taught to feel that he is no alien
upon the soil, but that this is his country and his home.”<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the elections of 1868, however, Congressional
Reconstruction was overwhelmingly triumphant
throughout the South and, with a fringe of whites,
a black pall was thrown over the region.</p>

<p>So determined were the ruling political leaders
of that day, to enforce their will upon a crushed and
impoverished people, that in South Carolina in 1870,
to enforce the provisions of legislation for social
equality, these alien law makers did not hesitate to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
abrogate the elementary rule of the criminal law,
which provides that the accused shall be deemed innocent
until proven guilty, and so shaped the legislation,
of the Civil Rights Act, that any one accused
of violating its strict and far reaching provisions,
on failure to prove his innocence of the charge, became
liable to a fine of one thousand dollars and
also imprisonment in the State penitentiary for five
years at hard labor, which was increased to six
years upon failure to pay the fine. Any one aiding
or abetting in the infraction of the law was liable to
a term of three years in the State penitentiary, with
the loss of the right to vote or hold office.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Now, it was while men’s minds in South Carolina
were intensely agitated by the immense sweep of
this act, that the whites of one of the religious denominations
of this State found presented for their
consideration, what was deemed by many of the
various denominations as the entering wedge for
the removal of distinctions between the races in the
establishment of religious equality.</p>

<p>With regard to equality between men, it has been
declared that there are at least four clearly distinguished
connotations attached to the word, and a
great variety of shades in each. These four connotations
of equality are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. Social equality, the tests of which are that we can invite
each other to meet our friends in our homes without
any thought of condescension or patronage and that our
sons and daughters may freely intermarry....</p>

<p>2. Political equality, which is confined to the common
possession of a vote....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>3. Religious equality, which consists in common access to
religious privileges on the fulfilment of the conditions prescribed
by the church or the religious bodies.</p>

<p>4. Equality before the law, where the law courts are open
to all alike for the protection of person and property.”<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The South Carolina law of 1865 gave to all the
Negroes the right to sue and be sued, and to receive
protection under the law in their persons and
property, and therefore apparently the law courts
were opened to all alike; but whether the Negroes
thereby obtained a right to trial by a jury of their
peers is a question.</p>

<p>As to those members of the colored race possessing
seven-eighths or more of Caucasian blood, as far
as law could make them, they were white.</p>

<p>Reconstruction attempted to extend to all of the
colored race what had been extended to this portion;
and now a portion were applying for religious
equality.</p>

<p>The question was whether there was any distinction
between religious and social equality?</p>

<p>That depends upon the estimate of each individual
as to what “The Church” is.</p>

<p>If it is in truth and fact a divine institution, then
the necessity of subjecting it to those regulations
which experience has proven most expedient, for
the proper adjustment of civil relations, is not very
clearly apparent.</p>

<p>If it is not a divine institution, then it is a social
organization, no matter how high the plane upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
which it is operated, and religious equality brings
in its train social equality.</p>

<p>The attempt of British divines, face to face with
the color question in South Africa, to readjust the
religious views of the fifties, directed at people
mainly outside their own doors and to justify the refusal
to extend religious equality to the blacks in
the Dominions, on the professed ground that there
is not complete spiritual equality among men and
that the final award for the use cannot be made a
basis for the adjustment of earthly relations, moves
somewhat limpingly, and, in lucidity, falls far below
the utterance of that profound Negro, who has
so clearly set forth the rights of his race in America,
in the following declaration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Negro has a God ordained right to protest against
his exclusion from means of self support. He has equal
right to protest when deprived of legal and civil justice,
or when the opportunity of knowledge or sober living is
denied him. He has no just cause of complaint, however,
when excluded from social intercourse with the white race,
for the obvious reason that mankind does not mingle on
terms of social equality—a fact as true of black men as of
white. Nor is Negro exclusion from membership in white
churches a trespass on Negro rights, for after all, a church
is neither more nor less than a social family.”<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Of the Negro who made this sane well balanced
pronouncement it is fitting that a white South Carolinian
should have something to say, although he
has been absolutely ignored by the most cultivated
members of his race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>As we shall later note DuBois, who today comes
nearer being recognized as the leading Negro of
America than any who can be mentioned, has claimed
that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“the greatest stigma on the white South is ... that when
it saw the reform movement growing and even in some
cases triumphing, and a larger and larger number of black
voters learning to vote for honesty and ability, it still preferred
a Reign of Terror to a campaign of education, and
disfranchised Negroes instead of punishing rascals.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In 1874 in South Carolina, Judge John T. Green,
a Republican, was a candidate for governor
against D. H. Chamberlain. Green was a South
Carolina Unionist, a lawyer of ability against whom
it was impossible to find anything to hang a charge
on. Chamberlain was the most brilliant of all the
carpet-baggers and after he defeated Green and became
governor of South Carolina he did turn to a
great extent against the rottening thieves who had
raised him to that position. His opposition to black
Whipper most dramatically expressed, flashed all
over the United States, when that Northern born
Negro was a candidate for judicial honors, in the
piquant phrase—“The civilization of the Puritan
and the Cavalier is in danger”—made this Union
soldier from Massachusetts almost a type of the
fighting reformer, and there was need of such, although,
as DuBois claims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“—it is certainly highly instructive to remember that the
mark of the thief which dragged its slime across nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
every great Northern State and almost up to the presidential
chair could not certainly in those cases be charged against
the vote of black men.”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But when Chamberlain found, two years later,
that in spite of his attack on those of his supporters
of whom he was certainly entitled to declare that
they were worse than he was, he nevertheless could
not be the leader of what was best, he went back to
the rotten element where, as the best of whites and
blacks claimed in 1874, he always could be found
when it suited his purpose; for the great mental
gifts of the man made him prefer to reign in hell
than serve in heaven. The fight against him was
in 1874 led by Comptroller General Dunn, a Republican
from Massachusetts. The candidates named
by the Independent Republicans were Judge Green,
a white South Carolinian, and Martin R. Delany, a
Negro from the North, for governor and lieutenant
governor. Allusion has been made to Delany before.
He was born in Charleston, Virginia, in 1812,
the child of a free Negro mother by a slave father.
He was the recipient of an education which enabled
him to support himself and achieve some distinction.
He had resided in Pittsburgh for some
time; had been in partnership with Fred Douglass;
had founded the first colored total abstinence society;
had moved to Canada and from there led a
party of black explorers through a part of Africa,
for which he had been noticed by the Royal Geographical
Society of Britain about the year 1859;
and, returning to America, had served in the Northern
army with a commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>By General J. B. Kershaw of South Carolina, who
with Wade Hampton and General McGowan all supported
the nominees, his absolute honesty was testified
to.</p>

<p>Every effort was made by the bulk of the whites
to support this attempt of the most honest of the
Negroes and Republican whites to put honest men
in office, Hampton going so far as to declare in the
public prints over his signature:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I look upon it as the imperative duty of every good citizen
whatever may have been his own previous predilection
to sustain heartily the action of that convention (of the
whites); for our only hope is in unity. The delegates to
that convention set a noble example of patriotism when they
sacrificed all political aspirations, all personal consideration,
and all former prejudice for the single purpose and
in the sole hope of redeeming the State.”<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Most of the notorious Negro leaders supported
Chamberlain, R. B. Elliott being made chairman
of Chamberlain’s Executive Committee; but a great
number under Congressman R. H. Cain, Ransier
and others, less notorious than Elliott and Whipper
and not as gifted, stood staunchly for honest government.
Cain went so far as to state that Green,
who lacked very little of selection in the Republican
convention which nominated Chamberlain, could
have easily obtained the few votes necessary for
such, as they had been offered his supporters at a
comparatively small price; but that he and his
friends had refused to purchase them. He also
called to the attention of an audience of some thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
in Charleston that the white judge he had
voted for as mayor in 1865 was presiding over a
meeting supporting this effort of black Republicans
to secure good government. But the most striking
fact that the meeting developed was the entrance
into politics of the profoundest thinker the Negro
race has ever produced, William Hannibal Thomas,
author a quarter of a century later of that remarkable
book—“The American Negro—What He Was,
What He Is, and What He May Become.” Thomas
had just reached his 31st year. At the close of the
War between the States, while the harpies black and
white in 1865 were winging their way Southward,
a wounded United States soldier, he was lying in a
hospital, with his right arm amputated above the
elbow, having volunteered at the outset and rising
to the rank of sergeant. Upon his discharge,
after five months treatment, for three years he was
a student of theology, going to Georgia in 1871 to
teach. He moved to Newberry, South Carolina, in
1873 and was admitted to the bar in January, 1874.
As a delegate from Newberry he supported the
movement for reform. During the absence of the
committee on credentials, he was invited to address
the convention. It was reported:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He made a stirring address in which the Bond Ring
was effectually shown up. It was time that a stop should
be put to crime and fraud in the State. It was time that
the country should understand that the citizens of the
South demanded peace and good government. It was a
fallacy to say that in this movement, the Republicans of the
State were abandoning their party principles. The plain
truth was that the people in their might intended to rise
and shake off the shackles of slavery and political bondage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
The colored people had given evidence of their earnestness
by asking their white fellow citizens to join them in this
effort. Intelligence and respectability must rule in the future
and the colored race must see to it that they were
educated up to the standard. By harmonizing it was not
meant that either race should give up its party principles.
It meant only that both the majority and the minority
should have fair representation in the government and there
could be no permanent peace and prosperity until this was
established. Ninety-nine years ago the American people
had rebelled against the British Government because they
were taxed without representation. How could they expect
a large minority to submit to this now? Our white friends
must help us heartily. They must not approach us with
gloves on. They must convince us that they are in earnest
and will join us in the effort to reform the government and
purify the State. I believe they are in earnest in their
professions this time and it remains for us to receive their
proffered help in the same spirit in which it is tendered.
Beyond a doubt in four or six years the white race will be
in a majority in this State. It is bound to come to this and
if we show now that we are willing to share the government
with them, we will get the same from them when the white
majority shall have reached and passed the colored vote. It
is common sense to do this nothing more. He heartily urged
upon his race the necessity of working for Reform. He said
he had been in the Union army in the late war but he for
one was ready to shake hands across the bloody chasm and
forget the past and unite with the Conservatives in securing
wealth and prosperity for the State.”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This utterance seems to have won for him a position
upon the committee on platform of five white
and six colored members, one of the latter Cain, a
congressman; yet Thomas was selected to submit
it to the convention. Except in minor particulars
it was the same as that which the convention nominating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
Chamberlain had framed, a not unreasonable
platform for a Negro to support in 1874 in South
Carolina, although scarcely acceptable in all its
planks to the whites. In a total vote cast of 149,221,
Judge Green was defeated by a majority against
him of 11,585. Yet the strength of the vote cast
against him was not without its effect upon the
brilliant Chamberlain, who, from that time, shed his
former skin and became a reformer.</p>

<p>How far a question which just about this time
arose in the Episcopal Church may have affected
political conditions is not to be asserted positively;
but that it did affect the minds of whites and blacks
can hardly be doubted, for, to not a few it was, above
all, a religious question. And a religious question,
to not a few, calls for sacrifice.</p>

<p>In the year 1875 there was presented in the Diocesan
Convention of the Protestant Episcopal
Church of South Carolina the application of a
colored congregation for admission into union with
the Convention, which application was referred to
a committee to be appointed by the bishop to examine
into and report upon in the following year.</p>

<p>In the minds of many men in the Southern States
the admission of Negro delegates involved consequences
which might be far reaching and this was
very plainly presented in one of the two reports
presented in 1876. This report opposing admission
presented the matter in these words in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The members of this congregation with very few exceptions
are mulattoes, many of whom were free before the
war and were known as a peculiar class in our community,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
owning slaves themselves and generally avoiding intercourse
with those who were entirely black. Some of this class had
established with their former masters and among our white
people generally reputations for integrity and civility....
The females of this class sometimes held relations with white
men which they seemed to consider and respect, very much
like, if not truly marriage. The results of such associations
are numerous in our streets. It is this class in which miscegenation
is seen and which tempts to miscegenation. If
miscegenation should be encouraged among us, then this
class should be cherished and advanced.”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The mover of this report might have gone further.
He might have shown the evidences of interests
in the record office, upon the part of white men
by deed and will from time to time, in the recognition,
to some extent, of the claims on paternity.
How powerful this appeal could become to some is
evidenced most strikingly in a will made as far
back as 1814,<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> and the value, therefore, of this
presentation at the Convention lay in the fact that
it turned attention full upon that phase of this question
which Southern white men are most apt to
ignore.</p>

<p>The imagination of the average Southern white
man does become intensely excited over any intimation
of that form of intercourse between the races
which is most distasteful and repugnant to the
whites, but from which there is the least likelihood of
miscegenation to any perceptible degree. The imagination
of the Southern white man is not, however,
keenly alive to the steady, continuous progress, almost
inevitably resulting from the presence side by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
side in one section of great numbers of the two
races. Yet if miscegenation is a danger, it is not
less so while proceeding in the way in which it is
most insidious and least shocking to the whites.</p>

<p>To the educated moral mulatto this determined
opposition by those who sought or were willing to
accept joint political action, must have created distrust.
When to that, violence grew sufficiently to
bring from Jefferson Davis denunciation, it is not
surprising that a man of the brilliancy and political
astuteness of Chamberlain should have made himself
an immense power in South Carolina and drawn
to himself a following which it took every effort of
the whites to overthrow.</p>

<p>Indeed, without Wade Hampton, it could not have
been effected. In a convention of 1876, of 165 members,
the leader of the Straightout faction could not
gather more than 42 votes.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> But in August of the
same year when Hampton<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> threw the weight of
his personality in its favor, by 82 to 65, the policy
was adopted. It is an interesting fact that while
the colored men W. J. Whipper and R. B. Elliott,
Cardozo, Gleaves and H. E. Haynes are all mentioned,
the name of W. H. Thomas appears in no
history of Reconstruction that the writer has read.</p>

<p>Cardozo, the Treasurer, was warmly championed
by Chamberlain, who declared of this colored official:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let me tell you that if I knew that your suffrages would
sink me so deep that no bubble would rise to tell where I
went down, I would stand by F. L. Cardozo.”<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>Chamberlain knew and R. B. Elliott, the brainiest
of all his colored opponents, knew that it was useless
to try to array Negroes against such a friend
of the colored brother as that; and Smalls, Chamberlain’s
friend, a good natured, bold mulatto, defeated
Swails for the chairmanship, by a vote which
indicated what was to be thrown for Chamberlain
as the gubernatorial nominee. Elliott therefore
made terms and was named for attorney general.</p>

<p>Yet during the exciting days of 1876 when both
houses of representatives were meeting, it was W. H.
Thomas upon whom the Republicans depended for
brain work. He was made a member of the committee
on credentials and, as chairman, reported in
favor of the seating of the Republican contestants
carrying the majority of the committee with him,
although opposed by T. E. Miller, an octaroon or
quadroon of considerable intelligence, who asked
for fifteen minutes to reply to Thomas.</p>

<p>Miller later stated that he had refused to sign
the report, because he thought that the Democratic
contestees ought to have been heard. When he was
beaten, he declared he had changed his mind, stating
that it was their own fault, if they were not present,
and announcing he was ready to sign the report.
It was reported that Thomas had, upon this second
utterance, made an inflammatory speech; but no part
of it was published by the paper so declaring, which,
upon the next day’s report, announced that in the
midst of the stormy session, Thomas offered a
prayer.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Thomas was on the committee of Ways and Means
and the Judiciary, and, until the collapse of the
Republicans, seems to have been the individual most
relied upon by the Speaker for all the serious work
of the session.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with the overthrow of the
Negro governments of South Carolina and Louisiana,
the report opposing admission of colored delegates
to the Diocesan Convention was sustained.</p>

<p>In 1879 the question came up again in a shape
harder to resist and resting upon the example of the
diocese of Virginia. The law-making power of
South Carolina had, however, meanwhile enacted a
statute making it—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Unlawful for any white man to intermarry with any
Negro, mulatto, Indian or mestizo; or for any white woman
to intermarry with any other than a white man.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Accordingly the lay delegates firmly opposed any
union whatever, whether of clerical or lay members,
with regard to the two races in the South.</p>

<p>Now if it is borne in mind that not only Calhoun,
whose influence upon political thought in South
Carolina had for many years been all pervasive; but
also the profoundest student who has ever studied
America, de Tocqueville, had condemned “all intermediate
measures” and declared that unless the
whites remained isolated from the colored race in
the South, there must come either miscegenation or
extirpation, at no time could the forecast of the
future of that section have been as gloomy as that
which appeared in the Census figures of 1880.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>The white population of Louisiana, which even the
war and its losses had only dropped a thousand or
two below the colored, had increased by an addition
of 92,189; but, in the same time, with Reconstruction,
the colored had been swelled 119,445, giving a
colored majority of something approximating 30,000.
In Mississippi, where the ante bellum Negro majority
of 84,000 had, by 1870, been reduced to 62,000,
it had now risen to 206,090. But in South Carolina,
with a smaller area and white population, the Negro
majority had risen to 212,000. In the five Southern
States, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi
and Louisiana, the gain of the white population
of only one, Alabama, had been greater than
that of the blacks. Under such conditions discussion
of that which was upon the minds of all was
almost unavoidable, especially as Southern thought,
freed from the shackles in which slavery had bound
it, was free to move in whatever direction it saw
fit and, from the pen of George W. Cable of New
Orleans, there appeared “The Grandissimes,” published
in 1880 and “Madam Delphine,” in 1881, of
which the color question constitutes what might be
called the motif.</p>

<p>The literary excellence of these works won the
author a place in art and they were followed by
other works of merit; but so strongly was the writer
finally impressed with that which had first moved
him to write, that in 1885 he dropped for a time the
garb of fiction and voiced his belief in the necessity
of a recognition of what he deemed a great wrong,
through a brochure entitled “The Freedman’s Case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
in Equity.” To Cable, the portion of the race which
was represented by the mulattoes and the quadroons
made the strongest appeal; but he was not alone in
the critical attitude he assumed toward the South.
In the work of Judge Albion W. Tourgee, a Northern
soldier, who had staked his all on Reconstruction,
with criticism, was voiced, in “A Fool’s Errand”
by “One of the Fools,” something very much
like despair. Later brooding, however, drew from
this author a more critical and decidedly pretentious
study, entitled “An Appeal to Caesar,” a study of the
Census of 1880, from which, with some reason, he
prophesied a speedy Africanization of the South,
and in which he called upon the inhabitants of that
section to bring forth fruits meet for repentance
while there was still time.</p>

<p>Certainly there was basis for the claim. At no
time had the rate of increase of the blacks been so
high as the Census disclosed in South Carolina,
Mississippi and Louisiana in 1880. Yet the first
named set herself resolutely against any relaxation
of the rule of rigid separation of the races, and in
1888 brought to a conclusion the discussion concerning
the admission of clerical delegates to the
Protestant Episcopal Convention, by a resolution
reciting the “absolute necessity for the separation
of the races in the diocese,”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> effected upon a basis,
putting all subsequent decisions within the control
of the lay delegates.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>In the years in which it had been maintained in
the South Negro supremacy had done more to destroy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
the belief of the bulk of the Northern public,
as to the capacity of the race to assume the full
duties of citizenship, than any argument of whites
could have achieved. The following extracts from
a letter of George W. Curtis at this date is interesting.
Referring to conditions in the fifties, he
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was mobbed in Philadelphia and the halter was made
ready for me and I was only protected by the entire police
force merely because I spoke against slavery.”<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>
</div>

<p>With freedom of discussion assured, he now, in
December, 1888, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am very much obliged by your letter of Nov., I do not
think the feeling of this part of the country is precisely
understood in your part. It is in a word this, that admitting
the force of all that is said about Negro supremacy, the
colored vote ought not to be suppressed and the advantages
based upon it retained. Of course I do not say it should be
suppressed. I am assuming that there is great reason in
the remark that under the same conditions the people in
the Northern States would do likewise, and I ask whether,
under that assumption, the people of those States ought to
expect to retain what they are not entitled to? It is unreasonable
to ask acquiescence in the suppression of legal
votes, which makes the white vote in Mississippi count
more than the white vote in Massachusetts or New York.
An educational test would be of no avail in a community
where color is the disqualification according to Mr. Grady
and Mr. Watterson. I shall be very glad to hear from you
and I should like to know the reply to the statement, that it
is not fair to suppress the vote and retain the advantages
based upon it.”<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>The reply of the individual to whom this letter
was addressed may well be omitted, in the light of
what follows.</p>

<p>In 1889 two publications appeared from Southern
sources most powerfully portraying the advantages
of freedom of discussion and the inestimable value
of that which Mr. Curtis had described as “the
fundamental condition of human progress,”—“the
right of the individual to express his opinion on any
and every subject.” The first publication was the
careful, exact and searching analysis of the condition
of the mass of the blacks contained in “The
Plantation Negro as a Freedman,” by Philip Alexander
Bruce of Virginia. The second, the remarkable
editorials of Carlyle McKinley, in <cite>The News
and Courier</cite>, of Charleston, S. C., upon the impending
movements of the freedmen in the United States.</p>

<p>With a prescience absolutely astounding, when we
consider the only available source of information at
that date, the Census of 1880, the same from which
Judge Tourgee had drawn the figures upon which
he based his gloomy prophecy of the speedy Africanization
of the South, Mr. Carlyle McKinley wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Negro question and all questions growing out of it
will be rendered one hundred fold more easy of prompt and
right adjustment when the Negroes themselves are more
equally distributed throughout the republic.”<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Differing in toto with the work of Judge Tourgee,
which had unquestionably in some quarters produced
a profound impression and one which was not
obliterated until the figures of the Census of 1890<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
were published, in 1889 Carlyle McKinley confidently
declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The currents which are moving from nearly every part
of the cotton belt towards the Mississippi basin will not
stop there. The Southern States have already all the
colored population that they want and more than they
want. Future movements in the same direction must inevitably
extend beyond the cotton and cane fields of the
region and being deflected around the northern borders of
Texas spread into the vast prairie country beyond or perhaps
curve northward into the States bordering the Mississippi
and its tributaries.”<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>
</div>

<p>About a month later the same paper in an editorial
entitled—“The Dispersion of the Colored Population”—admirably
outlined the true policy which
should guide since the importation of slaves and
slavery itself had been abolished:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Negro Question, whatever it be, is properly a national
question, it should be settled on a national basis. It can
never be settled on any basis while the Negroes are concentrated
in one part of the country. The first interests of
the South and especially of those Southern States where the
Negroes are in a majority is to effect the general distribution
of the race more equally throughout both sections or to
remove the excess of the colored population in the South to
some part of the western territory which has not yet been
occupied.... So far as the South is concerned, the Negro
Question now is the question of how best to promote Negro
emigration northward and westward.”<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>
</div>

<p>At the time of the publication of these editorials,
the State of South Carolina was represented in the
Senate of the United States by Wade Hampton and
M. C. Butler. Both were members of families which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
had been identified with the history of the State of
South Carolina from the Revolutionary War. Both
belonged to the slave-holding planter class. Both
had served with distinction in the Confederate War,
rising respectively to the grades of lieutenant general
and major general; the former having established
a record while in command of the cavalry
of the Army of Northern Virginia, second to none,
in handling that branch of the service. In addition
Hampton had, in his own State, been the leader
of the whites in the great political struggle of 1876,
in which the Negro government had been overthrown,
in which contest, he had been ably seconded
by Butler. But the Hampton of 1867 had passed
through many experiences since General D. H. Hill
had commended his appeal, at that date, to the
Southern Negro to consider the South as his home,
and Green’s campaign of 1874 had probably convinced
him that the bulk of the Negroes preferred
the showy flashes of the characterless Elliott and
Whipper to the sober honesty of Delany and Thomas.
In the year that Gen. D. H. Hill, of South Carolina,
died, B. R. Tillman pushed to completion Hill’s educational
view with the founding of Clemson; while
to Senator Hampton was propounded the query
which the editorials had suggested, concerning the
diffusion of the Negroes:</p>

<p>“Would any injury result to the South from an
extensive exodus?”</p>

<p>The reply from that one in the South best qualified
to answer such a question might well stand also
as the best reply to the inquiry propounded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
George William Curtis to the author of this work,
before alluded to.</p>

<p>Hampton’s reply exhibited the broad statesmanship
of Paul Hamilton, Joseph Alston and Robert
Barnwell in 1803, before South Carolina had been
deluged with slaves, and the brave sincerity of
Robert Y. Hayne, in 1818, 1827 and 1839.</p>

<p>Hampton said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An inconvenience, but no injury. We would gladly see
the colored people move elsewhere, and we would be willing
to suffer any reduction of representation that might result
from their departure. It would deprive us of much of our
labor and make it a little harder for the present generation,
but it would be the salvation of the future.”<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Senator Butler then took up the matter, and in the
early part of 1890 sought to have enacted by congress
a bill providing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That upon the application of any person of color to the
nearest United States Commissioner, setting forth that he,
she or they desire to emigrate from any of the Southern
States and designating the point to which he, she or they
wish to go, with a view to citizenship and permanent residence
in said country, and also setting forth that he, she
or they are too poor to pay the necessary traveling expenses....
That it shall be the duty of the Quarter
Master General of the Army on receipt of such application,
to furnish transportation to such.” ...<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>
</div>

<p>For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of
this bill an appropriation of $5,000,000 was asked.</p>

<p>The bill excited some interest. It received most
naturally the unqualified support of Senator Hampton,
and it was also acceptable to Senator Vest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
Missouri, and other Southern men of prominence;
but it was not only opposed by Northern and Western
senators but also by one at least from the South,
Senator Vance, of North Carolina, although the argument
of the latter was marked by neither strength
nor depth of thought. On the other hand the argument
with which Senator Butler presented his bill
deserves consideration at some length and is apt to
receive it in the future. While presented in a different
style, it is comparable to the utterance of the
great orator and debater of his State, Senator
Hayne, upon somewhat the same subject in 1827.</p>

<p>Senator Butler said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall confine myself to a dispassionate and simple statement
of facts and of such reference to events, as candor
and truth justify.... To my mind it is too grave a subject
to be diverted by party considerations or confined within
the narrow boundaries and limits of party lines. It is all
pervading, momentous and important.... Whoever concludes,
that the quieting of the agitation which concerns the
political status of the Negro would be a settlement of the
race question, discloses, how little he knows of its magnitude
and comprehensiveness and how superficially he looks at
it.” ...</p>
</div>

<p>Proceeding with his argument Butler suggested:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The inquiry will be made why should the Negro move out
of the Southern States? He will not except on his own
volition. There is nothing in this bill which coerces him
or compels him to move. My answer, however, is that it
would be for his own good and for the good of his white
neighbors also. It cannot have escaped the attention of the
most casual observer that where the Negro remains in large
masses and exceeds in numbers their white neighbors, they
not only do not advance, but actually retrograde. It is not
needful for any intelligent white man to read St. John’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
dismal narrative of ‘The Black Republic of Hayti,’ or
Bruce’s graphic story, ‘The plantation Negro as a Freeman,’
or Froude’s ‘Negro in the West Indies,’ to establish the
truth of the proposition. On the other hand, observation
and experience convince us, that in regions of the South,
where the whites are largely in the majority, the Negro is
better off and the white man is better off. The Negro dresses
better and is more intelligent and thrifty and the white man
is more prosperous and progressive.... It is conceded on
all hands, that if the Negro is to attain the full stature of his
manhood, if he is to become an independent self-reliant,
self-respecting man, and be made fully competent to discharge
all the high responsibilities and duties of life, he
must finally rely upon himself, he must elevate himself in the
moral social and industrial scale by his own exertions, by
his own self-assertion. To do this effectually, he must have
a fair chance in an open field. Can he be expected to accomplish
this; can it be expected of him under the shadow
and amid the scenes of dependence and inferiority which
enshroud him in the surroundings of his former debased
condition? Take him away from them and allow his pulse
of freedom to throb unobstructed by the memories and associations
of his servile bondage. I am not one of those
who believe in the total, hopeless depravity of the Negro
race. I believe that there are great possibilities in store for
him. I do not undervalue the worth of the labor of the
Negro in what was accomplished in the way of the material
development of the South. All that I mean to say is but for
that kind of labor, the South would have been far ahead
of her present development.... Nor do I underestimate the
obligations we are all under to the race for the fidelity and
most praiseworthy conduct during our depleting civil strife.
Whatever fate the future may have in store for him nothing
can deprive the Negro of this record; nothing can destroy
or obliterate the strong ties of affectionate kindness between
him and his former owner.... I repeat Sir it is for his good
and the good of his future generations, as well as the good
of his former master and his descendants, that I would
have him more generally distributed among the great mass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
of his white fellow citizens, from whose energy and thrift
and enlightenment and progress he can gather hope and inspiring
example in his struggle for an equal chance in
life.... It is not an uncommon thing to hear men say—‘Let
the negro alone; he makes a good peasant class; he is
the best laborer we can get for the cotton fields, etc.’ Do not
all such forget that there is no such thing as a peasant class
under our form of government? Do they not forget that the
Negro is a free American citizen, entitled by virtue of his
citizenship, if on no other account, to equality before the law
with the foremost citizens of the land, equality of opportunity,
equality of rights.... Is it not about time, Mr.
President that the thinking men of this country, men who
have some concern for the future of coming generations as
well as the temporary triumph of party should meet upon
the common plane of the general good and dispose of this
question fairly and humanely?... I should welcome such
a day as a new era in our history, from which to date new
hopes for the perpetuity of a constitutional republic.”<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is hardly necessary to state that the bill did not
pass. With the exception of his colleague, Senator
Hampton, and Senator Vest, of Missouri, it scarcely
received any support, and yet these Southern men
recognized, more than thirty years ago, what is only
now forcing itself upon the consciousness of the
North, because the Negroes themselves have at last
perceived the necessity of it.</p>

<p>But what do the prosperous think of? At this time
little or nothing was known of the two little white
republics, the Transvaal and the Orange River Free
State, except that they maintained themselves without
assistance in the heart of South Africa, surrounded
by millions of warlike African savages. To
the author of this work it seemed in 1890 worth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
while for the Northern statesmen and the Northern
public to inform themselves of the views and policies
of these people, before they legislated for the South
on matters pertaining to the Race Problem. These
little peoples had had no contact with Southern men.
They came from a different nationality. Would it
not be well for our Northern brethren to study
their methods before legislating for the South?
The suggestion was presented to <cite>The New York
World</cite>, then calling for ideas. But that great paper,
under Mr. Pulitzer, could not see the value. Later,
although conquered, as the South was, the Boers
have made their views felt in the world.</p>

<p>Was not an opportunity missed for obtaining helpful
information in advance of Bigelow’s White
Man’s Africa? Was not his book an indication of an
unexplored field? Did it not influence opinion in
the north of the United States?</p>

</div>

<p>As has been heretofore stated, George William
Curtis, the most eminent representative of former
abolition sentiment, at that date (1888), still alive in
the United States, had propounded a query to the
author concerning political advantages obtained
through the possession of the suppressed vote swelling
the electoral strength of the States, possibly compelled
to suppress its exercise.</p>

<p>Hampton, the most illustrious representative and
“one of the most distinguished leaders”<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> of the
overthrown slavocracy, had, in his reply to a press
interview, indicated how little desirous he thought
the South was of retaining any advantage based on
its possession, and his lieutenant, Butler, elaborating
the argument, had pressed for a diffusion of the
Negroes throughout the United States.</p>

<p>The fates gave Mr. Curtis the last word.</p>

<p>In <cite>Harper’s Weekly</cite> in the early part of 1891 appeared
an editorial entitled “A Sign of the Times.”
It was in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The associations, which under the general name of Farmers
Alliance, are organized throughout the country, are a
sign of the times not to be overlooked. They are the political
form which is given to a feeling which is observable on
all sides, extending quite beyond the circle of those who
actually take part in such associations.... The mainspring
of the movement is hostility to what is called the
aristocracy of wealth. This hostility is due to the conviction
that consolidated capital commands special privileges,
which are denied to the greatest industrial interest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
country, that of agriculture.... The most striking illustration
of this movement was that in South Carolina. A
Farmers Convention composed of white Democrats, who
were opposed to what they called the aristocratic Democratic
Ring, made the present Governor ‘Ben’ Tillman, the Democratic
candidate. His main appeal was to the poor
whites or ‘buckra’, as they are called, and despite the fact
that he was opposed by Judge Haskell, a representative of
the old governing class, who had the good will of most of
the colored leaders, Mr. Tillman was overwhelmingly elected....
Tillman’s election, which was a signal defeat of the old
Democratic regime in South Carolina was followed by the
defeat of the chief representative of that regime, Senator
Hampton, for re-election to the Senate.... One striking
incident in the campaign was the speech of a colored Republican,
who opposed Judge Haskell and who said that Tillman
had made both the whites and the Negroes readers and
thinkers.”<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The colored man to whom Mr. Curtis referred was
the Rev. Richard Carroll, of Orangeburg, later of
Columbia.</p>

<p>In the early fall of the year 1890 he had, in a
letter to the editor of <cite>The News and Courier</cite>, opposing
Negro excursions, given, in addition to the very
sensible views he put forth concerning such, an indication
that he was alive to the greatest need of his
race and how best it might be met. Five years before
Booker Washington came upon the stage and twenty-two
before he saw the light, Carroll seems to have
seen it and pointed to it as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our Northern friends are turning their attention to the
needs of emigrants in the West. We should save money to
buy homes while land is cheap.”<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>That Carroll was, at that date, a vigorous, original,
independent thinker and speaker, will be indicated
by a fuller description of the incident which
Mr. Curtis alludes to above.</p>

<p>Upon the division which occurred in South Carolina
between the followers of Judge Haskell and
Mr. Tillman, the Republican party in that State,
mainly composed of Negroes, had begun to stir and
a convention had been called of the leading colored
men of the State to consider the advisability of endorsing
Judge Haskell and supporting his candidacy,
and, the delegates having assembled, a motion was
made to leave the matter to the Republican executive
committee. The resolution obtained support
from many members in strong speeches. It was opposed
by one speaker. The following is the newspaper
report of the speaker’s remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Rev. R. Carroll, of Orangeburg, could not approve
leaving the matter to the Republican executive committee,
because he knew the committee would endorse the Haskell
ticket (How do you know?). Because one of the leaders told
me so. I am here to oppose the colored people taking any
action whatever. We have got what we have prayed for
so long, a split in the Democratic party. Join one side now
and we will grasp a shadow. Let the thing work. He
believed Tillman ought to be elected (Voices—‘Oh No’). Well
let me talk. Before Tillman was nominated, we were all Tillmanites.
(Voices—‘No, No’). We all rejoiced. We wanted
his success. Now he has been nominated. Tillman has
done us more good than any living man since the war.
He made colored as well as white people thinkers and
readers. Heretofore all Democrats went into office on 76
and the Negro Question. Tillman came along and let the
Negro alone (Voices—‘Hamburg, Ellenton’). He put people
to thinking of other things than the Negro. He ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
be Governor, and if I was a white Democrat I’d cast 10,000
votes to reward him. I am not afraid of Tillman. I’m
afraid of the men who got into his waggon and were pulled
into office by him. The white people are divided, but the
moment that the Negro comes in, they will get together
(applause). Both parties will turn on the Negro and he
will have to run to the mountains.... If you endorse
Haskell I’ll enter politics with 100,000 others (‘Won’t vote
for Tillman’). He’ll be governor just the same.”<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Although Carroll was in a minority, he fought the
question to a vote, replying to the charges with
vigorous thrusts and with regard to the claim that
those whom Tillman represented were the lynchers
of Negroes asking: “Were they not led by aristocrats
as well as common men?”</p>

<p>In fact Carroll appreciated, in advance, what Mr.
Curtis deeply interested as he was and keen observer
also, never quite grasped, viz., that the dominant faction,
in South Carolina, did not intend to permit the
Negroes to participate. And this was in fact the
greatest fact of the Tillman movement and one
which made it utterly unlike all apparently similar
efforts in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and
other Southern States. The head of the camel never
having been permitted to enter in South Carolina,
the difficulty experienced in the other States in removing
the camel, when he had completely filled the
tent, was never felt in South Carolina.</p>

<p>In storming his way to place and power, Tillman
unquestionably appealed to a class, the farming class,
whom he declared constituted seventy-five per cent of
the white population, and whom he also averred had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
been discriminated against. But Tillman really
had less prejudice against the old families of South
Carolina than many who opposed his candidacy.
His people before him had been identified with the
soil of South Carolina for generations. His father
had held Federal office under Andrew Jackson, and
one of his ablest lieutenants, W. D. Evans, was, in
1890, still living on the land originally granted his
ancestor in the days of the province of South Carolina.</p>

<p>Once established in power, Tillman was for all
classes.</p>

<p>But Mr. Curtis, clean and lovable man as he was,
never could entirely free himself from the feeling
that, as an abolitionist, he had felt toward the class
which had led the South through the struggle in
behalf of slavery. He had great hopes that the
elevation of Tillman and the overthrow of the Hampton
regime meant a chance for the Negro to come
back to some exercise, even if a restricted one, of
the suffrage. He expected that there would be a
marked difference in the feelings and sentiments of
those whom Tillman led and those who had preceded
them; and in a letter of Jan. 21, he thus exhibited
it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do not know if you have seen a paper by the Rev. A. D.
Mayo, who for ten years has been busily engaged in promoting
education in the Southern States. He holds that the
class which Tillman represents and not the old planting aristocracy
is the real hope of the Southern country, and he
makes a very strong statement.”<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>But no class has any monopoly of selfishness and
while it was most unfortunate for South Carolina,
yet it was in accordance with human nature, that
one of the first considerations of the class which had
seized the reins of power in South Carolina in 1890,
was to benefit its own class, by an attempt to perpetuate
those very conditions which for eighty years
had done more to injure South Carolina than any
one thing in her history, and which her wisest sons
had unavailingly opposed, viz., the retention of a
mass of ignorant, agricultural laborers, reduced as
close to the condition of serfs of the soil as it was
possible in each period to accomplish; for this is
what the law, enacted in most of the cotton States
at that date, did in fact bring about, by taxing out
of existence those agencies which might have relieved
the State of considerable numbers of Negroes.</p>

<p>The South Carolina Act, passed December 4,
1891, can stand as typical of this legislation, which
was based upon the determination of the white agriculturists
of the Lower South, constituting as they
did about seventy per cent of the white population,
to hobble, well within their reach, cheap Negro labor.
Coupled as the passage of such legislation was with
the fierce declarations against black brutes, with
which the perpetrators of such sought to excuse
the numerous lynchings of this period, it was apparent
that, while the vengeance was swift in overtaking
the blacks who violated white women, the
pound of cure was preferred to the ounce of prevention;
and so, exposing their women to that risk
which seemed inevitable with the tremendous Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
population which abounded in the South, the men
who made the laws still clung to cheap Negro labor.
It is true that as a whole, in the section covered even
by South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi,
the white population had gained upon the
Negro population and was at this date but slightly
inferior in numbers, amounting to 2,917,000 whites,
to 2,966,000 Negroes, in this black belt; but just
what proportion of whites were absolutely independent
of the Negro agricultural laborer it would
be difficult to estimate. That there were then and
are now a very great number, who would profit to a
very great degree by an assisted emigration of
Negroes, and that these whites were of the class
whose women folk necessarily were most exposed to
the risk which a juxtaposition of such an immense
mass of Negroes presented, growing race prejudice
prevented the perception of, and the members of
this class lent their influence to this injurious legislation
formulated as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No person shall carry on the business of emigrant agent
in the State without first having obtained a license therefor
from the State Treasurer.</p>

<p>Section 2. That the term ‘emigrant agent’, as contemplated
in the Act, shall be construed to mean any person
engaged in hiring laborers or soliciting emigrants in the
State to be employed beyond the limits of the same.</p>

<p>Section 3. That any person shall be entitled to a license,
which shall be good for one year, upon payment unto the
State Treasurer, for the use of the State, of one thousand
dollars in each county in which he operates or solicits
emigrants, for each year so engaged.</p>

<p>Section 4. That any person doing the business of an
emigrant agent without first having obtained such license<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall
be punished by a fine not less than five hundred dollars and
not more than five thousand or may be imprisoned in the
county jail not less than four months or confined in the
State prison at hard labor not exceeding two years for each
and every offense, within the discretion of the Court.”<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is doubtful if the injury which had been inflicted
upon the South by the vicious Federal legislation
of 1868, had, in any way, been greater than by
its checking the natural diffusion of the Negroes
throughout the Union in consequence of their emancipation
and the military overthrow of those opposing
such.</p>

<p>The effect of the legislation of 1868 had been to
direct and stimulate a movement to the South of
Northern Negroes and white adventurers which
banked up the Negro population there, taught all
to consider themselves ladies and gentlemen, a fact
which is still apparent in the apparel in which many
attempt to perform heavy manual work; and, until
they were disbanded in 1890, was most ludicrous,
in their military aspirations, as the Kodak by Johnson
shows.</p>

<p>The overthrow of Reconstruction in 1876, did to
some degree produce diffusion and by the Census of
1890 it became noticeable even in South Carolina,
where the Negro population was densest, that while
the numerical increase of the Negroes was still
greater there than the whites, the rate of increase
of the former had fallen below the latter. Yet in
South Carolina the Negro population still exceeded
the white by 226,296, a greater excess than appeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>even in Mississippi, a State of greater area and with
a more numerous white population, where the excess
of the Negro population was but 197,698.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp98" id="f184" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f184.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Negro National Guardsman—South Carolina, 1890</span><br>
Product of Congressional Reconstruction</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Under such circumstances it was patent that legislation
in either State which tended to restrain the
egress of the Negroes, even if temporarily of industrial
benefit to the land owners and agriculturists,
was against the true interest of the State and the
people, and, accordingly, in South Carolina, in the
columns of “The Cotton Plant”, the organ of the
South Carolina agricultural class of that date, the
author of this work began an attack upon the law
in a series of articles.</p>

<p>Without asserting that it was in response to this
agitation, it nevertheless is a fact that closely following
upon it, in 1893, the law was amended by the
addition of a clause in the nature of a compromise,
namely:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent
emigrant agents operating in this State between the 1st
day of July and the 31st day of December of any year.”<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This amendment, permitting the opportunity for
assisted removal of the Negroes during that half of
the year when such was least liable to interfere with
their contracts for labor, admitted of a gradual
removal of numbers of them and was a concession to
public opinion and political morality by those who,
with their votes and influence, controlled the political
situation.</p>

<p>By 1890, it was scarcely to be doubted, that a
great change in sentiment was taking place in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
world or rather in those three great countries which,
from their position, were most able to effect the
opinion of the world. In Great Britain, the United
States of America and Germany the extravagantly
liberal and humanitarian ideas, with regard to the
race question, which had marked the twenty-five
years preceding 1890, were giving way to something
which might be described by the word race-imperialism.
In Germany it made its appearance
in many forms, but more noticeably in the colonial
ventures, which off the coast of East Africa were
smeared with a recrudescence of the slave trade.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
How it grew in that country and to what astounding
lengths of caste culture it proceeded, would be beyond
the scope of this study, but it might be mentioned
that, by Paul Rohrback, without any credit to the
author, Calhoun’s black “substratum” theory was
openly avowed as the basis of colonial expansion.</p>

<p>Great Britain, with the Jameson raid and its
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sequellae</i>, gave an illustration of race intolerance
that shocked the world, but avoided the use of the
black in conquering the white.</p>

<p>In the United States it took shape in the various
constitutional conventions in Southern States, aiming
to disfranchise the bulk of the Negro vote.</p>

<p>It was England, however, that altered the designation
of “The Brother in Black” to “The White Man’s
Burden.”</p>

<p>In every way in 1890 the Negro seemed to have
failed. His profligacy was exaggerated, but in his
profligacy he had betrayed Judge Tourgee. A study
of the Census of 1890 by the author of this work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
indicated that in a total population of 62,620,000 in
the United States, 45,770,000 were native whites;
9,240,000 were foreign born whites; 6,339,000 were
Negroes; 1,131,000 were mulattoes; 110,000 were
Mongolians and 58,000 civilized Indians.</p>

<p>Comparing the two sections: There were a little
more than twice as many native born whites in the
North and West as in the South. There were about
twelve times as many foreign born whites and
about seven times as many civilized Indians with
fifty times as many Mongolians, but there were only
one-twelfth as many Negroes and one-fifth as many
mulattoes.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>In the same year in which Tillman had risen to
power in South Carolina, Mississippi had disfranchised
the great bulk of her Negro majority and,
with his control of political affairs, Tillman set to
work to accomplish the same thing in South Carolina.
By 1895 he had succeeded in obtaining a
constitutional convention and in that year it met.</p>

<p>For almost two centuries the Negroes had been
trained in slavery. Then for a decade they had
enjoyed what was much more akin to unbridled
license than liberty. For about twenty years succeeding
that they had been, by every device which
could be conceived of, stripped of the exercise of the
franchise and to a very great degree excluded from
jury duty. The proposition was now to exclude the
vast bulk of them legally from the franchise. It
is interesting to consider and observe in what way
they received the suggestion; for they were now absolutely
without white aid, and dependent entirely
upon such arguments as they themselves could advance.
There was no attempt to hide the purpose.
It was openly avowed that the main purpose of the
constitutional convention of South Carolina for
1895 was to frame a law, by which the tremendous
preponderance of the Negro electorate should be
reduced to an inconsiderable minority. This had
been accomplished in Mississippi, and the inconsistency
of the Emigrant Tax Law, restraining in
the State those whom the law makers had to protect
the State from, escaped attention for the time.</p>

<p>Blunt and rough as he was in his political utterances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
the prime mover for this convention, Senator
B. R. Tillman, with a breadth of thought greatly to
his credit, sought unceasingly to make it representative
of all factions, classes and conditions of the
white population of the State and, when it finally assembled,
it was found to be so. In addition it contained
a sprinkling of Negroes, through the presence
of six Negro delegates from two coast counties,
where they were in such overwhelming numbers as
to preclude their exclusion by any methods afforded
by existing laws.</p>

<p>The attitude, behavior and utterance of these six
Negroes in this convention, in the State where
twenty years previously the members of their race
had held their most pronounced legislative orgy and
to which they now came, to what they must have
realized were the political obsequies of the race, had
in it, sentimentally considered, something of the
pathetic. It should be borne in mind that those who
did come now could only come from those two counties
where the Negroes were at their lowest, if
contact with whites was elevating; for, in Beaufort
and Georgetown, the whites composed a very small
minority.</p>

<p>It was not a time, however, for sentimental considerations,
and to fuse the general mass of the
convention into a condition appreciative of the
scheme it was aimed to present at that stage in the
proceedings, Senator Tillman reviewed at great
length and with terrific force the previous frightful
excesses of carpet-bag government and Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
rule in the State. Upon the adoption of a resolution
for the incorporation of his speech in the journal
of the Convention, with a fairness, a milder man
might not have exhibited, he requested that the replies
of such of the Negro delegates as desired to
speak, should also be therein printed.</p>

<p>That Negro delegate designated by him as “the
ablest man of color I have ever met,” W. J. Whipper,
(Dan. Chamberlain’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piece de resistance</i> in the seventies),
certainly the most notorious of all who rose to
prominence in Reconstruction days, failed to avail
himself of the privilege. While far less able, with
a manly determination distinctly to his credit, Robert
Smalls did, and defended his character with
courage. He was accused of corruption. He
pointed to the fact that he had been pardoned, and
he claimed with great earnestness that the pardon
had been granted him without solicitation on his
part, and in spite of his urgent demand for trial.
While his remarks do not indicate any exceptional
intelligence, nor his reasons for desertion the clearest
conception of what constitutes public morality,
there is a ring of manly courage in his speech which
wins sympathy.</p>

<p>After setting forth the above claim, he concluded
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. President, I am through with this matter. It should
not have been brought here. All the thieves are gone, they
are scattered over the nation; but I have remained here.
My race has honored me with a seat on this floor and I shall
serve them to the best of my ability. My race needs no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
special defense, for the past history of them in this country
proves them to be the equal of any people anywhere. All
they need is an equal chance in the battle of life. I am
proud of them and by their acts towards me, I know they
are not ashamed of me, for they have at all times honored
me with their votes. I stand here the equal of any man. I
started out in the war with the Confederates; they threatened
to punish me, and I left them. I went to the Union Army.
I fought in seventeen battles to make glorious and perpetuate
the flag that some of you trampled under your feet.
Innocent of every charge attempted to be made here against
me, no act or word of yours can in any way blur the record
that I have made at home and abroad. Mr. President, I am
through and shall not hereafter notice any personal remark.
You have the facts in the case, by them I ask to be judged.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But it must not be imagined from this, that the
speaker was in any sense hacked. On the contrary
he continued to participate in the work of the convention
to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>As an amendment to Section 34, of the draft of
the Constitution, which provided—“The marriage of
any white person with a Negro or mulatto person
who shall have one-eighth or more Negro blood,
shall be unlawful and void.”—Smalls proposed the
addition,—“and any white person who lives and cohabits
with a Negro, mulatto or person who shall
have one-eighth or more Negro blood shall be disqualified
from holding any office of emolument or
trust in this State, and the offspring of any such
living or cohabiting, shall bear the name of father
and shall be entitled to inherit and acquire property
the same as if they were legitimate.” But the Convention
voted it down and not improperly, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
though clever politics, the concluding clause was
vicious legislation. The amiable boldness of the mulatto
Smalls won for him, however, general tolerance
and some regard; but he was not intellectually
in the class with that octaroon, Thomas E. Miller,
who, in the minds of most persons, made on this
occasion the greatest display of talent.</p>

<p>Miller made many speeches and furnished much
acceptable copy for the press. He, therefore, not unnaturally,
loomed large in the eyes of the knights of
the quill, and his ablest speech was later utilized,
by the most cultured representative of the race in
this country, Professor W. E. Burghardt DuBois,
as one buttress of a defense of Reconstruction, in a
paper read by him at the annual meeting of the
American Historical Association in 1909, which was
published later in the <cite>Review</cite>. Still the speeches
of both Smalls and Miller were defensive.</p>

<p>Of another and less known colored delegate to this
convention, this could not be said as denoting his attitude.
While bearing himself with dignity and
strictly observing the proprieties of debate, the
mulatto of whom mention is next made, eloquently
illustrated the adage, that “the business of an opposition
is to oppose.” The man and his efforts historically
considered deserve some recognition.</p>

<p>James E. Wigg, was born at Linden Park, Bluffton,
Beaufort District, South Carolina, March 25,
1850, the son of a colored woman by a white man.
As a small boy he attracted the attention of Gen.
David Hunter, upon whom he waited at Hilton Head,
who, after the war, took him with him to Washington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
D. C., and placed him at Whalen Institute. He
was said to have been well versed in theology, and
“an earnest follower of Swedenborg.”<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> His work
in the Convention was marked by a distinct exhibition
of intelligence. He submitted a draft for a
constitution which was creditable, and he proposed
an ordinance, to the Committee on Finance and Taxation,
of distinct merit. It constituted politics of a
high order. It was a bold challenge to the white
majority, on a line hard to defend the unfavorable
report of the Committee in response to.</p>

<p>Wigg’s ordinance was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Be it ordained by the people of South Carolina, in convention
assembled, that the Comptroller General, County
Auditors, County Treasurers and all persons charged with
the collections of State or municipal taxes, be and are hereby
required, to keep separate and distinct accounts of all
tax returns and taxes paid by white and colored taxpayers
and that the same be always open for public inspection.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Convention voted this down, although the subject
is known to be one upon which much loose
generalization is continually indulged in as the basis
of political appeals to voters.</p>

<p>But Wigg struck a more telling note than this.
The concluding clause of Article 1, Sec. II being
reported:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After the adoption of this constitution any person who
shall fight a duel or send or accept a challenge, for that
purpose, or be an aider or abettor in fighting a duel, shall
be deprived of holding any office of honor or trust in the
State, and shall be otherwise punished as the law shall
prescribe.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>To this Wigg suggested the simple addition, “or
any one engaged in lynching.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The amendment
was voted down, but in what position did the vote
so disposing of it place the law-making whites?
How does it read today?</p>

<p>Wigg’s speech on the suffrage clause, from the
standpoint of his race, was also a strong presentation
of the subject, pitched upon a high plane, eloquent
and dignified. No extracts from it will do it justice.
To be appreciated at its full value, it must be read
as a whole. In it was none of that amusing buffoonery,
which in another colored delegate’s remarks
so captivated the press representatives; but
it did contain not a little biting sarcasm. It is a
speech well worth the perusal of the careful student
of history, who is desirous of informing himself
of the various styles of men, our institutions
and our practices have evolved. But with all that
has been stated, yet the most interesting incident
connected with this colored man’s service in the
Convention, was his clash with the strongest and
most influential member of that body, in an impromptu
debate, arising almost accidentally, in
which, by no stretch of imagination, can the colored
man be said to have been worsted. That he owed
his triumph to the weakness of the position of his
adversary was his fortune, and he used it to effect.</p>

<p>As has been before suggested, by passing such a
law to restrain the egress of the Negroes, as the new
regime had done in 1890, the inconsistency of declarations
concerning the dangerous characteristics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
of the race had been made manifest, and in the full
tide of his progress as leader of the Convention,
Senator Tillman found himself on a shoal from
which it took some floundering to get again into
natatory water.</p>

<p>As reported in the press the incident appears as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Senator Tillman said he would preface his remarks by
reading from his first or inaugural message, when he advocated
township government.... ‘At that time we were
hampered by this Sinbad’s old man, the Negro. He is here
and he is going to be here and we must look out for the
nigger in the wood pile.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Wigg (a young colored man) asked Senator
Tillman:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Do I understand that you object to the presence of the
Negro in South Carolina?”</p>

<p>“Senator Tillman: Not a bit, but I would place no restraint
upon his emigration.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wigg: Did you not sign a bill calculated to prevent
his leaving?</p>

<p>“Senator Tillman: I never signed such a measure.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>“Mr. Wigg: I mean the act imposing a tax on emigration
agents.”</p>
</div>

<p>To this distinct specification of the act passed
while he was Governor Tillman at first hastily
claimed that it had been passed during his predecessor’s
term of office; but later, on reflection, made a
point of informing the Convention that he found he
had signed it and desired, “to apologize to the State
for having done so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>The author of the Act, a cotton planter from Marlboro,
W. D. Evans, then arose and also apologized
for it, and a verbal pledge was given, that the Act
should be repealed. At that time the Act was in
its amended form, only operative for one-half of
the year. But so far from being repealed, the only
action concerning it, was the making of it operative
for the whole year as originally drawn, license reduced.</p>

<p>As dissatisfying as such a statement may be to
those to whom the injustice of it, and the disregard
of a promise given under such solemn conditions, is
repugnant, it must be borne in mind, that similar
legislation of the State of Georgia had been, in the
mean time, reviewed by the Supreme Court of the
United States, and sustained upon the grounds <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter
alia</i>, that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If it can be said to affect the freedom of egress from the
State or the freedom of the contract, it does only incidentally
and remotely.”<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Supreme Court of the United States, therefore,
shares with the Lower South the responsibility
for this harsh and unwise restriction of the right of
labor to its fullest wage, as well as the denial to a
peculiarly ignorant and helpless mass of the population,
of an assisted egress from localities where they
are said to be such a menace from their extraordinary
numbers, that a setting aside of all law and depriving
of individuals of life without law by mobs
is sometimes by some people justified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>But, while arguing for labor its right to go where
it wishes to win its highest wage, we need not shut
our eyes to the rank selfishness of the industrial
agencies, which sweep out of a community the bulk
of the able-bodied males and leave only the dependent
women and children as a burden on it. That,
however, could and should be met by legislation
preventative of the breaking up of families simply
to meet the demands of industrial slavery. But the
right of the laborer to all that his work can earn
should be protected, nevertheless.</p>

<p>As fruitful as the incidents of this extraordinary
Convention were, in illustration of phases of the
Negro question, the most remarkable of all, however,
remains yet to be narrated. It has been previously
stated, that in 1865, when the States of the
then defunct Confederacy endeavored to rehabilitate
themselves, as members of the Union, after Emancipation,
but before Reconstruction, both South Carolina
and Mississippi adopted codes, in which were
the provisions that “every person who may have of
Caucasian blood seven-eighths or more shall be
deemed a white person,” thus separating such from
“persons of color”, a denomination including all Negroes
and mixed blood having less than seven-eighths
of Caucasian blood, who were declared at the same
time, “not entitled to social or political equality with
white persons.”</p>

<p>This would appear to have been only another way
of stating that those who did have seven-eighths or
more of Caucasian blood were entitled to social and
political equality with the whites. But Reconstruction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
as has been shown, swept this legislation out of
existence, in the attempt then made to place all upon
one plane of social equality, and to punish as severely
as a law could be framed to, such as might be accused
of any discrimination of a social nature. This
preposterous piece of legislation was in its turn done
away with when Reconstruction passed away, and
in its place there was enacted the law which penalized
marriage between whites and Negroes. In
the South Carolina convention of 1895, an attempt
was made to so frame the law, as to make it conform
to the view held in South Carolina and Mississippi
in 1865; but to this there was opposition in the
shape of an amendment reading as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sec. 34. The marriage of a white person with a Negro
or mulatto person who shall have <em>any</em> Negro blood, shall be
unlawful, and the parties to such marriage, upon conviction
shall be punished as the General Assembly may direct.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Over this amendment to the report of the committee
much discussion arose and among other expressions
of opinion, was one from Mr. Sligh of
Newberry, that it would be better to allow any one
with only one sixteenth of Negro blood to raise
white, rather than force such, to raise colored children.
Sentiment was, however, against his view,
and the proposed amendment was accepted as above
outlined.</p>

<p>But in two weeks, after many renewals of discussion
as to the wrong and injury which might result
from accusations apt to be based upon a proportion
so indefinite, according to press report:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On motion of Mr. W. D. Evans, Sec. 34, was recurred to,
and trouble began. Mr. Evans proposed to amend the section
by providing that the miscegenation law shall not apply
to persons of mixed blood, whose status is that of white
people. Mr. George Tillman stated, that he was very feeble,
but that he felt compelled to say something on this subject.
For one, he had felt ashamed when the delegate from Beaufort
had clapped his hands, and declared that the coons had
a dog up a tree. He was further mortified to see that the
gentleman from Newberry (Mr. Sligh) and the gentleman
from Edgefield (Mr. B. Tillman) goaded and taunted into
putting in the constitution, that no person with any trace
of Negro blood should intermarry with a white person and
that for such marriage the Legislature should provide punishment
even beyond that of bastardizing children and adulterizing
marriage. Mr. Tillman said the Mississippi law
forbidding marriage between white people with those with
more than one-eighth Negro blood is the old South Carolina
law. If the law is made, as it now stands, respectable families
in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton and Orangeburg will be
denied right to intermarry among the people with whom they
are now associated and identified. At least one hundred
families would be affected, to his knowledge. They had sent
good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners
and taxpayers. He asserted, as a scientific fact that
there was not a full blooded Caucasian on the floor of the
Convention. Every member had in him a certain mixture
of Mongolian, Arab, Indian or other colored blood. The pure
blooded white man had needed and received an infusion of
darker blood, to give him readiness and purpose. It would
be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of
scandal, horror, feud and bloodshed to undertake to annul
or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of
Negro blood. By the rule of evidence traditional notoriety
was admissible in proving pedigree. The doors would be
opened to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the
witness stand, that the father or the grandfather, or grandmother
had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins.
Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
the world with dynamite, to prevent or avenge attacks upon
the honor of his mother or the legitimacy or purity of the
blood of his father. He moved the restoration of the section
to its original form.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Mr. George D. Tillman’s effort was successful, and
the section, as finally adopted stands:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Art. III, Sec. 33. The marriage of a white person with
a Negro or mulatto or person who shall have one eighth or
more of Negro blood shall be unlawful and void.”</p>

</div>

<p>But if, in the personalities of Wigg and others,
illustrations had been afforded of the advancement
of the Negro in refinement, culture and morals, in
the mass, the race was by no means fit to discharge
the full duties of citizenship in the South. Even as
the most active and progressive moved out and into
other regions, they seemed to bring to bear upon
the question, in propria persona, an argument which
was inclining the inhabitants of the North and West
more and more to the vociferous expression, that the
Southern white man best understood the Negro;
that the Negro was better off in the South than elsewhere;
and that the South was the natural home of
the Negro.</p>

<p>However else the whites of the North might differ,
as Republicans or Democrats, philanthropists or politicians,
there was almost unanimity of opinion,
that the Negro was not wanted in the North. But
he was pushing in.</p>

<p>Despite all his other claims to greatness, therefore,
the fact, that he and his policy furnished the
most effective means and instrument for retaining
the Negroes in the South, contributed immensely to
the late Dr. Booker T. Washington’s remarkable
hold on Northern sentiment, for with his rise to
fame and financial power, the Negro question took
on a new phase. He had a mission and it is generally
considered to have been to lead the Negroes
to manual and industrial training, which it was in
the main, but also its aim in part was to keep the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
Negroes in the South; for that is the meaning of:
“Cast down your bucket where you are.”</p>

<p>Booker T. Washington came first prominently into
view by the speech from which the above extract
was taken, delivered by him at the Atlanta Cotton
States Exposition, in Atlanta, Georgia, September
18, 1895. What D. H. Hill had urged for the
Southern whites in 1866, Washington now urged for
the Negroes. The Northern people were growing
somewhat weary of the Negroes’ continual appeals
for political recognition and this speech, avoiding
such and couched in the most conciliatory phrases
concerning the Southern whites, was a surprising
departure. It struck a popular chord. It was written
up in the very best vein by the most celebrated
journalistic correspondent of that period, James
Creelman, then in the zenith of his career of feature
writing, as an “epoch making oration.” This writer,
commanding the pages of the most widely read New
York paper of that day, ranked—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Professor Booker T. Washington, President of the Tuskegee
(Alabama) Normal and Industrial Institute, as the
foremost man of his race in America.”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But Creelman did not stand alone. The editor
of the Atlanta Constitution telegraphed to the North
that “the address was a revelation.”</p>

<p>The Boston Transcript declared: “It dwarfed all
the other proceedings and the exposition itself.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>President Cleveland was even quoted as affirming
that “the exposition would be fully justified if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
did not do more than furnish the opportunity for
its delivery.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>The key-note of the speech has been before noted.
In addition it contained two specific declarations,
which constituted “the revelation”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. In all things that are purely social, we can be as separate
as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to
mutual progress.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>2. The wisest of my race understand, that the agitation
of questions of social equality is the extremest folly and that
progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come
to us, must be the result of severe and constant struggle
rather than of artificial forcing.”<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>
</div>

<p>When to these expressions was added the further
declaration:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“that we shall prosper as we learn to dignify and glorify
common labor.”<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>—</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">it was scarcely surprising that the speech was
generally accepted in the South as a renunciation of
all hopes of social equality, and an acceptance of a
position for the Negro very near to that which Calhoun
had assigned to him—“the best substratum
of population in the world” for it would be one—“upon
which great and flourishing commonwealths
could be most easily and safely reared.”</p>

<p>What fault then could the superficial Southern
thinker find with such a policy? It certainly fitted
very admirably with that which Senator Butler
had declared some five years previously it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
“not a common thing to hear men say,” viz., the
Negroes make “a good peasant class.”</p>

<p>It is true the Senator had warned his fellow
countrymen “that there is no such thing as a peasant
class under our form of government”; but Washington’s
remarks were so much more soothing to the
South than Butler’s warning, that the average
Southern man put away from his contemplation the
possibilities dormant in the great mass of Negroes
packed in the South.</p>

<p>And if the Southern man is willing to chance
these possibilities, what reasonable being can blame
the more sensibly sectional Northern man, for his
cheerful readiness to finance the experiment?</p>

<p>That, in turning the attention of the race to manual
and industrial training, Washington performed
a great work is not to be denied. That, in influencing
many of his people to follow him in such a program,
he has raised the ambition of not a few to a
much higher plane than the race had shown itself
heretofore capable of, must be admitted, and these
are great achievements. But it is an error to imagine
that Washington ever made for himself or his race
any renunciation of the aspiration for social equality.
He condemned the agitation, not the aspiration for
it. In the opinion of Dr. Washington, “color prejudice”
was incompatible with true greatness of
soul, and the highest praise he could bestow upon a
man was that he was destitute of “color prejudice.”</p>

<p>Writing of President Cleveland, he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Judging from my personal acquaintance with Mr. Cleveland,
I do not believe he is conscious of possessing any color<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
prejudice. He is too great for that. In my contact with
people, I find that as a rule, it is only little, narrow people,
who live for themselves, who never read good books, who
do not travel, who never open their souls in a way to permit
them to come in contact with other souls—with the great
outside world. No man whose vision is bounded by color
can come in contact with what is highest and best in the
world. In meeting men in many places, I have found that
the happiest people are those who do the most for others;
the most miserable are those who do the least. I have also
found that few things, if any, are capable of making one
so blind and narrow as race prejudice.”<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Although of very different temperaments, between
the two colored men Booker T. Washington
and T. Thomas Fortune, there seemed to be quite a
sympathy. Washington in his autobiography avers
it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the summer of 1900, with the assistance of such prominent
colored men as T. Thomas Fortune, who has always
upheld my hands in every effort, I organized the National
Negro Business League.”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>
</div>

<p>T. Thomas Fortune is a man of education and
ability. As the editor for many years of the leading
colored paper in the United States, its columns
indicated that he certainly upheld the hands of Dr.
Washington. Indeed he did not hesitate to belabor
without stint the heads of such colored detractors of
Dr. Washington as Monroe Trotter of Boston and
others, even administering a rap or two to Professor
W. E. Burghardt DuBois, when the latter failed
to keep step with the Washington procession. But
T. Thomas Fortune was of too independent a nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
to be restrained from the expression of his own
view, and shortly before his surrender of his position
as editor of “The Age”, he published the following
declaration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The question of the right to marry and give in marriage
is at the bottom of the whole life of the Republic. The
Afro-American who says he does not desire social equality
is an unmitigated fool or an outrageous blackguard, who
sacrifices what he should know to be a primal right to a
subservient purpose.”</p>
</div>

<p>Can it be believed that a man sufficiently fearless
to make this declaration and feeling obliged to do
so, would uphold at all times the hands of an unmitigated
fool or an outrageous blackguard? It is
difficult to believe it. Therefore, it is reasonable to
assume that while Washington, with “the wisest”
of his race understood: “that the agitation of questions
of social equality was the extremest folly,” he
nevertheless cherished the aspiration. And indeed
it would be most unnatural if he did not.</p>

<p>Bearing all the possibilities in mind, the question
is, however, whether any policy which tends to keep
massed in the South so many of the Negroes as are
banked there, is to the best interest of the South, or
the Nation, or conducive of the greatest good to
the greatest number?</p>

<p>But Washington did not stand as the unrivalled
leader of his race. Two other members of it criticised
his leadership with arguments which could
not be brushed aside too lightly. The first of these
compiled in 1899, what was the most thorough investigation
into the conditions enveloping the Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
at the North, which had been printed up to that
time. The author of “The Philadelphia Negro” is
thus introduced by Dr. A. Bushnell Hart:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The most distinguished literary man of the race W. E.
Burghardt DuBois—an A. B. and Ph. D. of Harvard, who
studied several years in Germany, and as Professor of Sociology
in Atlanta University has had an unusual opportunity
to study his people.”<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Dr. DuBois’s book was an entirely different style of
work from the popular “Up from Slavery” published
a year or two later, “with the painstaking and generous
assistance of Max Bennett Thrasher”, as the
autobiography of Washington.</p>

<p>DuBois’s book, “The Philadelphia Negro” is a
most carefully made sociological investigation.</p>

<p>Later in 1903, Dr. DuBois published another
volume entitled: “The Souls of Black Folk”—in
which after a preface opening with:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Easily the most striking thing in the history of the
American Negro since 1876, is the ascendency of Mr. Booker
T. Washington.”—</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">followed by a fine tribute to his worth, the author
declares:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“the time is come when one may speak in all sincerity and
utter courtesy of the mistakes and short comings of Mr.
Washington’s career, etc.”</p>
</div>

<p>The criticism is this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and
South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro’s
shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation,
and the hands of none of us are clean, if we bend not our
energies to righting these great wrongs. The South ought
to be led by candid and honest criticism to assert her better
self and do her full duty to the race she has cruelly wronged
and is still wronging. The North, her co-partner in guilt—cannot
salve her conscience by plastering it with gold....
The black man of America has a duty to perform, a duty
stern and delicate, a forward movement to oppose a part
of the work of their greatest leader. So far as Mr. Washington
preaches Thrift, Patience and Industrial Training for
the masses, we must hold up his hands.... But so far as
Mr. Washington apologizes for injustice, North or South,
does not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting, belittles
the effect of caste distinctions, and opposes the higher
training and ambition of our brighter minds,—so far as he,
the South or the Nation does this,—we must unceasingly and
firmly oppose them.”<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Between “the most distinguished literary man of
the race” and “the most eminent man whom the
African race has produced” there was then a profound
difference, for what could be considered, by
many, as the essential element of greatness in the
policy of Washington, was that, for which this
critic took him most severely to task, viz, his willingness
that the burden of the Negro problem
should be shifted from the shoulders of the whites
to those of the Negroes.</p>

<p>Admitting, for the sake of argument, that the
willingness of Northern and Southern whites, that
it should be shifted is not to their credit, there is a
virility in the promulgation of a policy for the Negroes
by a Negro, which seeks to force the Negro
“to stand upon his feet and play the game”, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>offsets many imperfections, and for that Dr. Washington
must get credit.</p>

Free Person of Color—Ohio, 1860</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The second of the two Negro thinkers who questioned
Dr. Washington’s leadership, has also been
quoted by Professor Hart; but of William Hannibal
Thomas, one of the few Negroes of distinct intellectual
force as before narrated, who participated in
the struggles of Reconstruction in South Carolina
and emerged, uncriticised, Dr. Hart has but two
allusions.</p>

<p>Of the author of—“The American Negro; What
he was; What he is; and What he may become,”
Professor Hart, in his own strong book, only says,
first:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He has made admissions with regard to the moral qualities
of his fellow Negroes which have been widely taken
up and quoted by anti-Negro writers.”<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Second:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Thomas, himself a Negro, asserts that the sexual impulse
constitutes the main incitement of the race, and is
the chief hindrance to its social uplifting.”<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In these two temperate utterances, as put, Professor
Hart conveys what might be understood as
disapproval; yet it can be urged in defense of
Thomas’ criticism of his race in the last particular,
that it is paralleled by the assertion of Professor
Lombroso, himself an Italian, concerning Italians,
when contrasting them with the English; while,
with regard to the first, it would be difficult to find
a paragraph framed by Thomas more suited for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
quotation by anti-Negro writers, than the following
in Professor Hart’s book:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Negro preachers are universally believed to be the
worst of their kind, and very often are. If things that are
regularly told by the white people and sometimes admitted
by the colored, are true, the majority of the Southern Negroes,
rural and urban are in a horrible state both physically
and morally.”<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Yet whatever the Negro preachers may have been,
there is good reason to believe that, in the cities,
their moral tone is improving, and there, now, high
exemplars of morality can be found.</p>

<p>Again, despite his apparent pessimism, the future
holds for Thomas a hope denied to not a few, who
are impatient of his probe. Where can be found
anything rising higher in optimism that the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We believe American Christianity has in the person of
the Negro, an unmeasured wealth of latent spiritual energy
which will be aroused and consecrated, when the notion of
sacerdotalism is scattered from before his clouded vision,
when transmitted ethnic fetichism is eradicated from his
religion and the virility of his nature, bared of empty
forms of righteousness, is breathed upon by the spirit of
God, himself.”<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The truth concerning this matter is, that Thomas
had gone too deeply into it to be readily understood
by those who have not had their powers of perception
quickened by that daily contact, which teaches
so much. Therefore, while Thomas’s book may seem
extremely pessimistic; yet, when his philosophy is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
boiled down, it is not very different from what Dr.
Washington is thought to have preached, that God
helps him who helps himself, or as Thomas puts it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Every endowment of manhood and womanhood is within
the reach of every human being, who puts integrity before
material gain, and self respect before mendacious folly.”<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>“When, therefore, the Negro race acquires in the broadest
and best sense an industrial education, there will come a
radical regeneration of Southern social economy, and Negro
education will stand then for home life, domestic industry,
public integrity and national welfare.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To some extent, therefore, the difference between
Washington and Thomas was temperamental.
Washington’s optimism led him to declare:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Despite superficial and temporary signs, which might lead
one to entertain a contrary opinion, there never was a
time, when I felt more hopeful for the race than I do at
the present time.”<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>
</div>

<p>What these superficial and temporary signs leading
to the contrary opinion were, Washington did
not disclose; but Thomas did:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am firmly rooted in the conviction, that Negroism, as
exemplified in the American type, is an attitude of mental
density, a kind of spiritual sensuousness; but that each of
these characteristics, though endowed with great persistency
and potency, is nevertheless amendable to radical treatment.”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>
</div>

<p>According to Max Nordau, spiritual sensuousness
is by no means a characteristic or state interfering
with great achievement; for he credits Ignatius
Loyola with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>But now to consider the view of this Northern
Negro.</p>

<p>With the possible exception of Alfred H. Stone,
it is doubtful if, up to this date, any individual has
proven himself better equipped for the discussion of
the Negro question than William Hannibal Thomas.
A comparison might warrant the statement, that if
Mr. Stone has enjoyed the wider range, Thomas has
been able to make the more exact study. If Stone
has the stronger mind, and it is still further
strengthened with a fuller culture, Thomas has the
more judicially balanced temperament. Thomas’
work is done. Stone’s has not yet reached its fullest
development. We can, therefore, get a clearer
idea of Thomas’ view in its entirety than we can
obtain of Stone’s.</p>

<p>No man has drawn more from his experience than
Thomas, and few have possessed such varied experiences
to draw from. Simply and modestly as
he sketches his life and pedigree, the brief recital
indicates opportunities for observation which were
most unusual, and, had he kept a diary, it would
have been simply invaluable. Should he ever publish
his impression of the men he has met and the
events he has been connected with, it could not fail
to be a most interesting and instructive book; for to
powers of observation, which are unusual, he unites
judgment which is distinctly admirable. Some brief
extracts may put the man and some of his views
before the reader.</p>

<p>His book opens with an explanation, indicative of
that which he thinks distinguishes the Negro from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
the white, characteristic traits rather than color,
after which he briefly states his own pedigree and
life history, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“None of my ancestors were owned in slavery, so far as
my knowledge goes. On my mother’s side I come from
German and English stock. My maternal grandfather, the
son of a white indentured female servant by a colored man,
was born at Bedford, Pennsylvania, about the year 1758.
My maternal grandmother was a white German woman,
born in 1770, and brought up at Hagerstown, Maryland.
This branch of my ancestry emigrated to Ohio in 1792; and
settled near the town of Marietta, where my mother was
born in 1812. On the paternal side my grandparents, who
were of mixed blood, were Virginians by birth. My father,
who was born in 1808, near Moorfield, in Hardy County,
removed to Ohio before attaining his majority. I was
born on a farm, in a log cabin, on the fourth day of May,
1843, in Jackson Township, Pickaway County, Ohio.”<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>
</div>

<p>After reciting the recollections of his youth, his
father’s active interest concerning, and his own
sympathy for, the “Underground railroad”, and his
efforts to educate himself, Thomas asserts that at
the outbreak of hostilities he tendered his services
in 1861 to the Government, but was refused admission
to the army on account of color. In a civil
capacity, however, he entered the 42d. Ohio Infantry
Regiment, and—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“was in the Big Sandy campaign with General Garfield,
and during the summer of 1863, with the Union forces at
Cumberland Gap, Tennessee.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the fall of that year he joined the 95th. regiment,
with which he remained, until the capture of
Vicksburg, when, returning to Ohio, he enlisted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
the 5th United States colored troops, and was appointed
sergeant, and after service in the Department
of the James, was in the assault on Fort
Fisher, North Carolina, and lost an arm in the capture
of the city of Wilmington.</p>

<p>Going South to teach, he took up his residence
first in Georgia, later in Newberry, South Carolina,
in 1873, and was appointed a trial justice. In
1876 he was elected a member of the legislature, and
after the fall of the radical governments of the
South, “gave up the practice of law and withdrew
from active participation in politics” to devote his
attention to the educational advancement of the
freedmen, in pursuit of which, he “visited every
Southern State and community.”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Certainly such a one would seem admirably equipped
for the task of discussing most interestingly and
instructively the Negro question, as a perusal of
his book clearly indicates. Why then, is the book
not more popular in the North, where is to be found
the great reading public of the United States?</p>

<p>Despite the advanced civilization of that section,
its enlightenment, and its assimilation of British
ideals, with the growth of the material prosperity of
its people, there has grown a belief that money, if
given with sufficient liberality, can cure any trouble.
This is more than hinted at in “The Souls of Black
Folk.”<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> How then can it be other than extremely
distasteful to those, so conscious of their great
generosity, to read in place of the encomiums with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
which the assisted writings of Washington abound,
the following audacious criticism:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our Northern philanthropists, with no trustworthy knowledge
of the conditions of the freedmen, have neither sought
nor acquired capable insight into the needs and wants of
Negro life. Having been influenced by the special pleading
of interested advocates, and their own imperious convictions,
it is consequently small wonder that they have hitherto
failed to deal with the problem in the most satisfactory manner.”<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is true that in considering:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“The two antagonistic forces which germinated at about the
same period in the Western world at Jamestown and Plymouth,”</p>
</div>

<p>Thomas thinks the product, as well as the seed, of
the latter is far superior; but, to the residents of
that portion of our common country, that has long
been axiomatic and does not wipe away the offense
of making admissions with regard to the moral qualities
of his fellow Negroes, which have been widely
taken up and quoted by anti-Negro writers.</p>

<p>Almost it might seem in anticipation of this,
Thomas says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In this age of realism illusions should have no place and
especially in a question of such perplexity as this and one
involving such vital issues. The Negro above all others
should welcome honest criticism, for in so doing, he will
discover that those who point out faults are not always
actuated by vindictive sentiments and he may learn that
timely reproof and wise guidance may be derived even from
the censure of enemies.”<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>With regard to the possibilities of improvement,
Thomas believes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That rural work constitutes a basis for character building
incomparably beyond that of any agency within his
(the Negro’s) reach.”<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>
</div>

<p>While Thomas’s view concerning the injury to the
South of the presence in it of the Negro is more
strongly put it is the view expressed by Senator
Butler in 1900, and of Senator Barnwell in 1803, in
all probability; yet it is a striking fact that in South
Carolina, since emancipation, after thirty years of
experience, we came back to the view expressed in
1865, and this, in spite of the fact that, as stated
by a great authority on the subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is very convenient for the Southern white man to include
everybody with a trace of Negro blood under the general
race designation.”<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Stone cannot include South Carolina as contributing
to what he styles:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The combined influence of Northern and Southern white
men and of Negroes and mulattoes to perpetuate an absurd
and unscientific fiction,”<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>
</div>

<p>for the South Carolina law with regard to intermarriage
between the races does not include every
one with a trace of Negro blood as a Negro. And
this brings us up to a consideration of this phase of
the question.</p>

<p>The view of T. Thomas Fortune, on the intermarriage
of persons of different races, has been
cited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>DuBois’s, expressed with temperance, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Among the best classes of Negroes and whites, such
marriages seldom occur.”<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Yet he maintains that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Any legislation against it, is inconsistent with the principle
of freedom of choice in a matter exclusively pertaining
to the individual.”</p>
</div>

<p>Twenty years later, in “The Comet”, he allowed
his fancy fuller play.</p>

<p>When Thomas reaches this point in his discussion,
we find neither the extravagant expression of Fortune,
nor the apparently varying views and fancies
of DuBois. Thomas says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is no doubt that judicious race amalgamation is
capable of exercising a profound and far reaching influence
upon <em>inferior types of people</em>. Degenerate people are always
improved by an infusion of virile blood; but the benefits
derived from wise race admixture are to be found in transmitted
capacity not color.... The redemption of the Negro
is impossible through any process of physical amalgamation;
it is possible and assured through a thorough assimilation of
the thoughts and ideals of American civilization.”<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Now, as has been shown, Washington thought a
color prejudice a thing to be lamented, and yet he
preached for years for the Negroes to remain in the
South; where Thomas says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is more absolute social equality and personal
freedom in the intermingling of the races than has ever been
obtained in the North, where, in the main the public social
rights of the Negro are respected.”<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>From which Thomas argues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That should wealth, culture and character come to the
great body of the Negroes, all trace of race prejudice would
disappear from our Southern section as effectually as it has
been obliterated in Portugal and the Latin countries.”<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If Washington happened then to hold the same
view as the above, even without expressing it, there
was no discord between him and his lieutenant, Fortune,
and therefore, while Mr. Stone was pondering
the problem of the mulatto, Washington, looking
with steady eye toward the future infusion of virile
blood, cried to the applauding white people of the
South;—“Cast down your bucket where you are.”</p>

<p>Is it for the best interest of all that the bucket
should be cast down where we of the South are now?</p>

<p>By the census of 1900, Mr. Stone’s State was the
one State of the three, South Carolina, Mississippi
and Louisiana with a Negro majority in 1890, which
showed no improvement in this respect.</p>

<p>Louisiana’s Negro majority of 789 had given place
to a white majority of 78,808; South Carolina’s tremendous
Negro majority of 226,926 had at last felt
the beginning of the ebb, and was 225,415; but
Mississippi’s 197,708 had risen to 266,430, and,
therefore, in Mississippi were the very worst conditions
and those most fruitful for race friction; for
Mr. Stone has declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A primary cause of race friction is the vague rather intangible,
but wholly real feeling of ‘pressure’ which comes
to the white man almost instinctively in the presence of a
mass of people of a different race. In a certain important
sense, all racial problems are distinctly problems of racial
distribution.... So today, no State in the Union would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
separate car laws where the Negro constituted only 10 or
15 percent of its total population.”<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In another lecture Mr. Stone had declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Negroes constitute practically a third of the population
in the South both city and country. In the North they constitute
but one fortieth of the city population and only an
insignificant, really negligible one-ninetieth of that of the
country.”</p>
</div>

<p>Yet, Mr. Stone quotes as an authority, Booker T.
Washington, who declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If we were to move four millions of the eight millions of
Negroes from the South into the North and West ... a
problem would be created far more serious and complicated
than any now existing in the Southern States.”<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>
</div>

<p>These two statements as they would be generally
understood, are inconsistent with each other and
contradictory. If it be meant that a sudden thrusting
out of four million people from one section, and
impelling them into another, as fast as they could be
moved, would precipitate a problem, no one would be
foolish enough to deny, or attempt to deny, that it
would. But, as the gradual introduction of four million
Negroes into the North and West could not bring
the mass of them up to more than 10 percent of the
whole population, then, in many respects, the problem
would be ameliorated by any policy which led
to their introduction in a reasonable process of diffusion,
although it undoubtedly would dispel some
dreams, and give rise to some friction and considerable
inconvenience for a while.</p>

<p>And, that even Booker Washington commenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
to see the advantages of diffusion, became apparent
in at least one utterance before his death.</p>

<p>But, before treating of conditions and opinions in
1910, some information may be obtained from a
careful consideration of what moral advancement
the culture of the slave-holding South had produced
in that class of its colored population, which as free
persons of color, in the period of slavery, could
themselves hold slaves.</p>

<p>In the city of Charleston, South Carolina, in the
year 1859 the list of taxpayers shows that 353 free
persons of color returned for taxation, $679,164.00
of real estate. They also returned for taxation 290
slaves. Of these tax payers the wealthiest was
Maria Weston, whose return for real estate was
$41,575.00, slaves, 14; horses, 1. That was one-seventh
of the value of the real estate returned by
the wealthiest white tax payer in the city and two
more slaves. But Maria Weston, while the wealthiest
of the free persons of color in Charleston, was
not very much more wealthy than R. E. Dereef and
Robert Howard, and the average wealth of the free
person of color was fairly up to the average wealth
of the whites. The story is told in Charleston that
when the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher visited the
city, after the war between the States he invited himself
to become the guest of R. E. Dereef, who received
him with admirable hospitality, personally
looking to it that the great man lacked nothing in
the way of comfort and treating him with perfect
civility; but studiously and tactfully avoiding all
efforts upon the part of his guest to establish an
intimacy. The great Abolitionist confided to a white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
resident his disappointment that he had met no
other member of the family or aroused in the breast
of his host any decided interest in one who had
done so much to bring about emancipation of the
Negroes. But his confidant called to his attention,
that he had been treated with admirable and uncomplaining
hospitality, by one whom he had relieved
of considerable property. Yet it must not
be imagined that all free persons of color owned
slaves. Of an interesting family, the Holloways,
nine taxpayers in all, the wealthiest returned for
taxation, real estate to the amount of $8,300.00,
while the total of the nine summed up $36,000.00,
only one of the nine, however, owned a slave.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>It is through what has been preserved by a member
of this family, that we get a glimpse of what
may be considered to some extent as the viewpoint
of this class. That the ideal of J. H. Holloway was
somewhat cramped may be admitted; but if so it
should also be admitted that the basis was one of
the strongest upon which an ideal could repose. It
was social purity. Holloway’s father, grandfather
and greatgrandfather had all been free men. He
was a saddler and harness maker by trade, but he
was nevertheless an aristocrat. He was an unobtrusive
individual, of gentle nature, true to his convictions
and very virtuous. Being opposed to vaccination,
he refused to pay the small fine imposed
and went to jail instead, assuring the white judge
who expressed his regret at being obliged to sentence
him, that he had no feeling about the matter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
believing the official was doing his duty. The intellect
of Holloway was not extraordinary and to
not a few his ambition may seem small and trifling;
but it was pursued with such a patient faith and
pious determination, as to impart to it, in the eyes
of some whites in the same locality, who had accomplished
something in life, a dignity entitling it
to respect. His position resembled that of a priest
of a dying cult, to whom the sight of the altars he
intensely revered, more and more deserted, as he
advanced in years, but the more added to the fervor
of his worship; and so Holloway, to the day of his
death, remained a devoted disciple of “The Brown”
or as it was later called “The Century Fellowship,”
the principle assets of which were a grave yard and
some minute books. Holloway’s life was a living
denial of the charge that the Negro has no interest
in the past or future, for to him both of these periods
were of importance. What was most noticeable in
his thoughts was the balance of them.</p>

<p>On his business card: “J. H. Holloway—Harness
Repair Shop, 39 Beaufain Street,” he had caused
to be printed a quotation from the Bible—“Let your
moderation be known to all men”, to which he had
put the very practical addition—“in charges.” Upon
the other side of the card he had paraphrased
Oliver Wendell Holmes, as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Know old Charleston? Hope you do</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Born there? Dont say so, I was too.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Born in a house with a shingle roof</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Standing still, if you must have proof</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And has stood for a century.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>
<p>“The Brown” or “Century Fellowship Society”,
which occupied almost all of Holloway’s leisure
thoughts, had been founded in 1790. In 1904 some
ceremonies were enacted upon the occasion of the
laying of a corner stone for the new hall, it was
hoped later to erect.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The address of welcome was
delivered by a venerable member, ninety-six years
of age, and was very brief. The religious services
were conducted by the rector of the oldest Episcopal
Church in Charleston, himself a veteran of the
Confederate war, who, as a major of engineers,
had contributed greatly to the “Defense of Charleston
Harbor,” the history of which, under such
caption, as author, he had also preserved. There
was an ode by a member of the Society, and an address
by a member of the board of aldermen of
the city, also an ex-Confederate soldier. But a review
of the aims and aspirations of the Society by
J. H. Holloway, throwing as it does a light upon the
point of view of a class, not given to undue exposure
of their opinions, was probably the most
important utterance of the occasion.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My first proposition is that our society was founded upon
right principles, having as its foundation stone Charity and
Benevolence, and its capstone social Purity. Environed as we
have been by the varied conditions through which we have
had to pass and to have survived one hundred and fourteen
years, with a record no organization may be ashamed of, so
we may well exclaim “To the Lord be all the praise.” Our
guests today represent the conditions through which the
Society has passed during the Century. On the one hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
we have the dominant race and on the other we have the
backward race. The first looked with a scrutinizing eye on
our every movement, so as to charge us with being a disturbing
element in the conditions that existed, and they
made stringent legislative enactments; and the public sentiment
of the masses was to discourage everything that our
Society stood for; but fortunately there were the classes in
society, and as our fathers allied themselves with them, as a
consequence, they had their influence and protection and so
they had to be in accord with them and stand for what they
stood for. If they stood for close fellowship, so did our
Fathers. If they stood for high incentive, so did our
Fathers. If they stood for slavery, so did our Fathers, to
a certain extent. But they sympathized with the oppressed,
for they had to endure some of it, and fellow feeling makes
us wondrous kind, and many times they had as individuals
helped slaves to buy their freedom, and on one occasion our
records prove that the Society loaned one of their members
the money to purchase his family. Our Fathers were public
spirited, for our records prove, that from 1811 to 1814
the Society was interested in the defense of Charleston.
So under perplexing conditions our Society passed more than
three score and ten years of existence until the war of the
sixties and while their material prosperity was at stake,
their sympathies were with the side that promised more
liberties and larger opportunities; however, the members of
the Society, not as an organization, but as individuals became
the firemen to protect the city from flames caused at
times by the shelling of the city. We have proof that some
of the sons of our members wore the Blue, and at least
one contributed his life blood for freedom at the charge of
Battery Wagner under the lead of the brave Col. Shaw,
of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, and thus the blood of
South Carolina and Massachusetts mingled as in the case
of the Revolution.... The change of conditions after the
War did not make any difference with our Society, they continued
in the beaten path of Charity and Benevolence; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
they still kept the compact close, feeling that the heritage of
the Fathers was only dear to their children, and as we had
three generations born since the organization, we could enjoy
social equality among ourselves.... In conclusion I
will say that we are not responsible for our birth, but God
has placed us where we could best honor Him, and his
command is—‘Honor thy Father and Mother that thy days
may be long’. So we are honoring our Heavenly Father’s
command in honoring our ancestry.”<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Had Holloway only lived to read the exposition of
the subject—“The Negro in the New World”, which
in 1910 appeared from the pen of the great English
explorer and Negro character specialist, Sir Harry
Johnston, he would have learned that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Money solves all human difficulties. It will buy you love,
honor and respect, power and social standing.”<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Would he have accepted this even from this great
authority? His Society was languishing. How
was the structure to be strengthened in 1904? In
that year President Roosevelt appointed as Collector
of the Port of Charleston, Dr. W. D. Crum, a
colored physician of that city, a respectable Republican
politician, well thought of by Dr. Booker
T. Washington, but not wealthy. To some, who
thought the appointment hardly the fittest, it
looked as if the incident was fanned into a national
question unnecessarily; but when it is noted what
its importance appeared to be to men like Mr.
Stone, of distinctly philosophical cast of mind in
consideration of the color question; and further,
that upon Mr. Taft’s elevation to the Presidency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
there was no reappointment, but instead the incumbent
was appointed as minister to Liberia, it
would seem as if there had been question of the
wisdom of the appointment elsewhere than in the
South. But whatever difference of opinion there
may have been on the matter of the appointment, it
would have been very difficult to find any reasonable
ground for condemning the appointee in his acceptance;
for he would have been less than a man had
he refused it. All through the verbal storm that
raged over it, the appointee remained perfectly
silent, concerning himself solely with the duties of
the office, and at the conclusion, when he departed
for Liberia, in a letter to the head of the agency
through which his transportation had been arranged,
there was only apparent warm affection for the
spot Holloway had so fondly alluded to, in the
paraphrased lines of Oliver Wendell Holmes.</p>

<p>Holloway evidently did not subscribe to the idea
of Sir Harry Johnston as to the power of money to
solve all human difficulties, for there were colored
men of means in Charleston at the time. It was
character, and particularly self control, that appealed
to Holloway. His selection, therefore, was
W. D. Crum, who had shown that he possessed characteristics
very akin to those which Holloway had
shown to be the ideals of the Century Fellowship
Society, although Crum’s forbears had not been free
persons of color before the War of Secession, a matter
of importance to Holloway.</p>

<p>Of another product of the old South a word may
be further said for the benefit of the fiercely prejudiced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>English authors, who are unable to believe
that any good thing can come out of the slave-holder’s
Nazareth.</p>

Free Person of Color—South<br>
Carolina, 1860</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>James H. Fordham, of the free persons of color
before the war, held the position of a lieutenant on
the police force of the city of Charleston, from 1874
to as late as 1896. He was a light quadroon, who
might have been passed for a Spanish officer. Taciturn
to a degree, he discharged the duties of his
office thoroughly and conscientiously. Scarcely
ever speaking, unless spoken to, and apparently
never ruffling the white roundsmen under his command.
Yet, in the longest speech he ever made,
backed as it was by appropriate action, he evinced
an understanding of, and devotion to the fundamental
principles of democracy which, if appreciated by
the great German people, might have saved them
from the pains and penalties they are now undergoing
for subjecting the world to the exigencies of
military ambition.</p>

<p>The occasion of Fordham’s speech was an incident
in 1891, occurring in one of those periodical struggles
by which democracy in the United States perpetually
renews its strength at the expense of officialdom.
At the close of a warmly contested and
close primary, the successful faction opposing the
municipal administration in Charleston, found it
difficult to bring the result in one ward to a count
and decision. Impatient and suspicious, as the delay
wore past midnight, a worthy but somewhat
choleric individual, of the faction announced successful
at every other point hours earlier, denounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
the presence of the police in the poll where the delay
was being maintained by the masterly inactivity
of the administration manager.</p>

<p>One of the policemen on duty, ordinarily as amiable
as he was strong and courageous, advanced toward
the citizen and angrily challenged the accusation
with the inquiry:</p>

<p>“What right have you to make charges against
the police?”</p>

<p>Before the citizen could reply, the quadroon
lieutenant sprang from his horse, pushed through
the crowd and, placing himself between the two,
the only colored man in a group of excited whites,
firmly but quietly said to the policeman:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What right has he to make charges against you? The
right of any citizen, at any time to make charges against
any policeman, and I am here to uphold that right.”<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is useless to comment upon this incident; for,
to any one who needed such, comment would be useless.</p>

<p>As an incident of the growth of caste feeling,
twelve years later in the same locality, a mulatto
policeman having arrested a drunken German for
noisily quarreling with his wife upon the public
streets was, upon the demand of the leading hyphenated
politician of the city, dismissed from the force.</p>

<p>In the years which intervened between the events
last narrated, the Democratic president, with regard
to whom Dr. Washington had asserted that
he possessed no color prejudice, had concluded his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
second term, made illustrious by the firm stand
taken by him in the Anglo-Venezuelan dispute, which
had been brought to his attention and fought to a
decision,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> against the extreme and arbitrary
claims of Great Britain, by that almost forgotten
Southerner, William L. Scruggs of Georgia.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the cloud in which this absolutely
proper stand for justice between nations and maintenance
of the Monroe Doctrine involved him for
awhile, on account of the belittling comments of
Anglophiles, Cleveland has passed into history as a
strong president and a great man. He was succeeded
in his high office by the gentlest mannered
and sweetest tempered individual who has ever exhibited
in such station the high personal traits
which adorned the character of William McKinley.</p>

<p>Whatever these two men thought concerning the
color question was no doubt discoverable; but it was
not announced as a new gospel; for while great in
spirit they were not noisily so. They were both
great men. Cleveland, the Democrat, was greater
in his public character and official achievements, the
Republican, McKinley, in the personal integrity and
absolute self abnegation which adorned his life and
crowned his end. Cleveland opposed to malfeasance
a rugged force, which did much to build up public
integrity, lamentably lowered in Grant’s two terms.
McKinley’s respect for law and order was so sincere,
that in his dying moments he interposed to protect
his assassin from the natural fury of the mob, thereby
defending an anarchist from the outburst of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
anarchy which the vile deed occasioned, and giving,
in his own suffering person, so interposing, the noblest
appeal that could possibly be made against
lynching.</p>

<p>The executive who succeeded McKinley was essentially
different. No president of the United
States has done as much as Mr. Roosevelt to wipe
out distinctions between white and black. That he
should have estranged Southern whites is not unnatural;
that he should have aroused the enmity of
Northern and Southern colored men discloses to
what an extent the Negro is amenable to impulse
rather than reason. Mr. Alfred Holt Stone has discussed
three incidents which occurred in Mr. Roosevelt’s
first term. Benjamin Brawley, a colored man,
discusses the even more important incident which
occurred in Mr. Roosevelt’s second term. In the
first three Mr. Roosevelt held the centre of the stage,
in the fourth, the Negroes were the actors, Mr.
Roosevelt only responding. Mr. Stone treats the
first three, in part, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Three incidents marked the progress of the controversy
which broke upon the country shortly after Roosevelt’s succession
to the presidency. These were the Booker Washington
dinner, the appointment of Crum, and the closing of the
Indianola post office. There were four parties in interest—Mr.
Roosevelt, the Southern press and people, the Northern
press and people and the American Negro.... The President
acted clearly within his ‘rights’ in each case. This
point must be conceded without argument. The dinner episode
was in itself no more than a matter of White House
routine.... Within forty-eight hours, the President was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
being denounced for having crossed the social equality dead
line through breaking bread with a negro.”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>
</div>

<p>According to Mr. Stone, the attitude of the South
was one of general disapproval, the attitude of the
Northern press a defence of the President. After a
searching consideration of some fifty or more pages,
in which Mr. McKinley’s attitude in distributing
patronage is compared to that of Mr. Roosevelt,
Mr. Stone discusses the attitude of the Negroes.
After taking up in turn various expressions by Professor
Kelly Miller, Dr. W. E. Burghardt DuBois
and Mr. William Pickens, Mr. Stone asks—“What
then is the real meaning of their words?” Mr.
Pickens says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“—one side advises ‘quietly accept the imposition of inferiority.
It is a lie but just treat it as the truth for the
sake of peace. Diligently apply to the white man the title
of gentleman, and care not if he persists in addressing you
as he calls his horse and his dog. Be patient. This general
disrespect and discrimination will develop into the proper
respect and impartiality at some time in the long lapse of
geological ages, just as the eohippus has developed into the
race horse, and the ancestor of the baboon into a respectable
Anglo-Saxon.’ The other side says, ‘I ask for nothing more
or less than the liberty to associate with any free man who
wishes to associate with me. Your colour discriminations,
legal or not, are all damnable, inasmuch as they draw an
artificial and heartless line, give encouraging suggestions to
the vicious and allow the stronger in brute power to force
bastardy upon the weaker without remedy. Colour has absolutely
no virtue for me and however much I am outnumbered
I will not retreat one inch from that principle.
However little my position might affect savage opposition,
by the God of your fathers and mine, I will never by voluntary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
act or word acknowledge as the truth what I know to be
the grossest of lies. And you might ask all the truly valiant
hearts of the world and the ages how they beat toward these
contrary tenets.’”<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is true this utterance was some five years later;
but Mr. Stone thinks that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“without the background of that Wednesday dinner at the
White House, the canvass which subsequently absorbed and
reflected such lurid colours would have given us an almost
lifeless picture, as tame and dull as the usual afterglow of
Southern appointments by Mr. Roosevelt’s predecessor.”<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To his discussion Mr. Stone appends the following
interesting little note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The substance of this paper was embodied in an article
submitted to several magazines while the Crum and Indianola
incidents were being generally discussed throughout
the country. The article was not found available.”<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the same year that Mr. Pickens was declaring
with fine oratorical fervor:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your colour discrimination, legal or not, are all damnable,
inasmuch as they draw an artificial and heartless line, give
encouraging suggestions to the vicious and allow the stronger
in brute power to force bastardy upon the weaker without
remedy.”<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">—three Negro companies in the United States Army
indicated, in their own way, their disapproval of
these distinctions. The incident is treated by Mr.
Benjamin Brawley, a colored writer of culture, as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In 1906 occurred an incident affecting the Negro in the
army that received an extraordinary amount of attention in
the public press. In August 1906 Companies B, C and D of
the Twenty Fifth Regiment, United States Infantry were
stationed at Fort Brown, Brownsville, Texas. On the night
of the 13th took place a riot in which one citizen of the
town was killed and another wounded and the Chief of
Police injured. The people of the town accused the soldiers
of causing the riot and on November 9th, President Roosevelt
dismissed, without honor, the entire battalion, disqualifying
its members for service thereafter in either the military
or civil employ of the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The author states, that, later, the civil disabilities
were, by President Roosevelt, revoked and he exhibits
the terms of a resolution in the Senate to investigate
the matter; but the fact that the President’s
action was sustained<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> apparently was not
of sufficient importance to be made a matter of comment;
nor the behavior of the soldiers.</p>

<p>The President’s comment at the time was eminently
sane, just and commendable. He wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fact that some of their number had been slighted
by some of the citizens of Brownsville, though warranting
criticism upon Brownsville, is not to be considered for a
moment as a provocation for such a murderous assault. All
the men of the companies concerned including their veteran
non commissioned officers instantly banded together to shield
the criminals. In other words they took action which cannot
be tolerated in any soldiers black or white, in any policeman
black or white, and which if taken generally in the
army would mean not merely that the usefulness of the
army was at an end, but that it had better be disbanded in its
entirety at once.”<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>The inability of even cultured Negroes to sympathize
with the view of the President was their misfortune
rather than their fault. It indicated that
they lacked the elementary principle essential to
the rulership of themselves, much less to the rulership
of others.</p>

<p>It was not so much the amount of attention as the
amazing attitude of the vast majority of Negroes
capable of understanding what had occurred, which
attended that attention. To the vast majority of
Negroes, irrespective of rank, culture or professions
of Christianity, there was something noble and
manly in the behavior of “the veteran non-commissioned
officers”, so absolutely repugnant to the practical
politician Roosevelt, a high type of white. The
inability of the succeeding occupant of the highest
office in this country, genial in disposition, liberal
in view; but yet unable to appreciate the flaming
zeal and prompt action, with which a real leader of
a free people meets such behavior in armed underlings,
marks a certain weakness in that Northern
white. Such weakness coupled as it was with the
behavior of such public men as Senator Foraker did
much to produce the deplorable incident ten years
later so properly stamped with executive disapproval
and inevitable punishment to the last degree.</p>

<p>It is quite possible and to some degree probable
that weak and vicious comments on Roosevelt’s action
in the Brownsville matter had something to do
with the Houston riot. The comment also affected
the Southern white man profoundly in his attitude
to colored soldiers and policemen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p>Despite the incidents related in the last chapter,
which might be claimed to be almost isolated or pertaining
to a very small class of the Negro population,
to comprehend clearly all that is embraced in
the diffusion of the Negroes throughout the United
States, and the consequent dissolution of the mass
in the Southern States, while endeavoring to grasp
what is so intelligently urged by Mr. Alfred Stone,
concerning “pressure”, the investigator should not
fail to realize that in the Southern States, if the
Negro was willing to accept unreservedly the position
of an inferior and a menial, there was formerly
no distinct repugnance to him, per se. In fact, with
a small class, the descendants of slave holders, he
obtained and still obtains tolerance and not a little
patronizing affection, being treated in about the way
in which a careless, amiable, hot tempered father
might treat an amusing child.</p>

<p>As long as the child remains a child, it might not
be so bad for him; but the question is what kind of a
man does it make of him?</p>

<p>With regard to the views and practices of the
whites of the Northern States concerning the Negro
question, they may be divided into three classes.</p>

<p>The first class, corresponding to a similar class in
Great Britain, may be not unfairly described as a
small, sentimental, somewhat hysterical class, lacking
in neither culture, character nor wealth. These
entertain a prejudice in favor of the Negro on account
of his color and previous condition of servitude.
At one period in the history of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
States, wielding power out of all proportion to the
wealth, culture or numbers of its members and representing
the disintegrating force of an idea to
“sap the power of rank, of wealth and of numbers,”
it has left its mark on the history of the country in
the great almost incalculable good of Emancipation;
and in the terrific injury, injustice and folly of Reconstruction.</p>

<p>The second class is best described as having no
color prejudice. While considerably larger than the
first, it is scarcely the largest in point of numbers;
yet, until very lately, it could have been declared
with accuracy, as the most influential class in the
Northern States. It is true that it must be borne
in mind that it has not yet felt what the most thorough
white student of the Race question has described
as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The vague, rather intangible, but wholly real feeling of
the ‘pressure’ which comes to the white man in the presence
of a mass of people of a different race.”<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But, with this reservation, it may be styled as
calm, tolerant, kindly tempered and quite considerate
of an opposing view; and, as its possessors are
singularly free from sentimentality, they wield just
the degree of power and influence which is the accompaniment
of such great qualities.</p>

<p>The third class is, in point of numbers, first, and
although, today, the power and influence this class
wields is not proportionate to its numerical strength,
it is slowly but steadily increasing its influence.
The great majority of the members of this class entertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
towards the Negro an intense prejudice.
Some members of it cannot bear the presence of a
Negro near them in any capacity; being utterly
unable to accept with any patience, from such, the
most menial services. Undoubtedly such a prejudice
tends to prevent miscegenation and, without it,
all the laws which may be enacted will offer but a
comparatively feeble bar.</p>

<p>On the other hand, wherever there are two races
living side by side in fairly kind feeling, as long as
men and women remain creatures of such an infinite
variety of individual tastes, desires, powers of restraint,
passions and appetites, miscegenation, to
some extent will prevail, and such being the case,
where the inferior exists in the greatest numbers
there will be the greatest result from it; while, on
the other hand, as the great numbers of the inferior
race are lessened, the tendency toward miscegenation
must also be lessened.</p>

<p>This happens from various reasons. First, from
the simple fact, that, with the lesser numbers of the
inferior race, there must be lesser opportunity.
Second, from the very important fact that the fewer
the number of the inferior race, the more its members
must be brought into contact with and under
the influence of the standards of the superior race,
and absorbing their ideals, with a consequent increase
of personal dignity, and decency; from which
will necessarily increase the disposition to refuse
solicitations provocative of miscegenation, except
on terms not readily granted.</p>

<p>From these deductions, it must be apparent, that,
in a broadly national conception of patriotism, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
opposed to sectionalism, however disguised, the natural
and slow diffusion of the Negroes throughout
the United States must result in an elevation and
improvement of the condition of the population white
and black, taken as a whole; although it is quite possible,
by some portions, which have been perfectly
free from any share whatever of the burden of an
inferior race, a share of the weight and responsibility
could then be no longer avoided, or discharged
entirely by sermons to the portions less happily
situated, or the payment of something like a bounty.</p>

<p>Finally, to those Southerners who cherish the wild
delusion, that, with a retention of great numbers of
the inferior race in their midst, a sentiment, backed
by laws against intermarriage, is sufficient protection
against miscegenation, the illustration afforded
by East Africa may be pointed to. East Africa lies
just south of the oldest civilization we know of, and
has been invaded in the past by horde after horde
of whites.</p>

<p>The Biblical story of Cain and Abel may be taken
in part as illustrative of the two vocations by which
mankind slowly arose from the savage occupation
of the hunter to the two higher divisions, namely,
those who tamed the beasts, and those who tilled
the soil.</p>

<p>Modern medical opinion is to the effect that no
occupation so develops the physical perfection of
humanity as the pastoral vocation; while reflection
would indicate that it must cultivate a stronger set
of characteristics than either hunting or tillage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>Bring into collision in a comparatively primitive
state a pastoral people and one engaged in agriculture
and the shepherds and herdsmen will rule.</p>

<p>But will their contempt for those they have
brought under and subjected to their rule suffice to
prevent miscegenation? That is the serious question
for the Southern man.</p>

<p>It is apparent in East Africa, where this contact
has existed for many generations, despite the preservation
of every racial prejudice which marks
the Southern white man, the superior race has not
avoided miscegenation, but, upon the contrary, it
has steadily progressed, until distinctions in color
are almost gone, and even the more stubbornly yielding
distinctions of facial traits and hair texture are
gradually giving away, and this miscegenation seems
to have checked progress in civilization.</p>

<p>Writing of the two classes of Negroes found near
the great African lakes, the explorer Stanley says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We discovered that there were two different and distinctly
differing races living in this region in harmony with
each other, one being clearly of Indo-African origin, possessing
exceedingly fine features, aquiline noses, slender necks,
small heads, with a grand and proud carriage; an old, old
race, possessing splendid traditions and ruled by inflexible
customs, which would admit of no deviation. Though the
majority have a nutty brown complexion, some even of a
rich dark brown, the purest of their kind resemble old
ivory in color and their skins have a beautiful soft feel, as of
finest satin. These confine themselves solely to the breeding
of cattle and are imbued with a supercilious contempt for
the hoeman, the Bavira, who are strictly agricultural. No
proud dukeling in England could regard a pauper with more
pronounced contempt than the Wahuma profess for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
Bavira. They will live in the country of the Bavira, but
not in their villages; they will exchange their dairy produce
for the grain and vegetables of the hoeman, but they will
never give their daughters in marriage but to a Wahuma
born. Their sons may possess children by Bavira women,
but that is the utmost concession.”<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>
</div>

<p>All of which indicates great pride still in the
superior race; but a reduction to what is practically
two classes of Negroes, as far as the outside world is
concerned. Note Livingston also in Southwest
Africa.</p>

<p>But in addition to the reasons advanced why this
matter of the diffusion of the Negroes through the
United States should be accepted as best, there is
the consideration that it is inevitable. That it is
in progress can no longer be doubted, although, as
Robert Y. Hayne declared in 1827, it would be, “a
very gradual operation.”</p>

<p>The strong grip which the Republican party maintained
in Federal politics for the sixteen years, up
to 1912, has in some measure to be credited to the
influx from the South of Negroes into the North
and West, where they most naturally and reasonably
vote the Republican ticket. Indeed it has been
positively asserted by one whose devotion to that
party could scarcely, at the time, have been questioned,
that they may have been brought there for
this purpose.</p>

<p>Says Professor Albert Bushnell Hart, in his very
interesting and instructive book, “The Southern
South”:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A systematic effort has been made to settle colored
people in Indiana, in order to hold that State in the Republican
column; and there are now probably nearly a hundred
thousand there, a third of whom settled in Indianapolis,
where they furnish a race problem of growing seriousness.”<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is true that the Census for 1910 only disclosed
in Indiana 60,280 Negroes; but Mr. Hart’s not unreasonable
estimate was probably based upon the
preceding Censuses of 1880, 1890 and 1900, alone
available in 1910, when he wrote, which did indicate
a rising rate of that species of population, from 15%
to 27%, while that of 1910 indicated for that State
a drop of 4.8%. A similar falling off being recorded
in Illionis, where the rate of increase dropped from
49 percent to 28.2 percent, and in Ohio alone of these
three great States, the rate increased. There it had
risen from 11 to 15 percent. Proceeding East, a
decline was also recorded for Pennsylvania from 43
to 23.6; for New Jersey from 47 to 28.5; for New
York from 40 to 35.2 percent. The total increase
of the Northern States east of the Mississippi from
the year 1900 to 1910 being only 142,363 as against
188,347 from 1890 to 1900; but west of the Mississippi
from 1900 to 1910 the increase was 107,747,
as against 51,194 from 1890 to 1900; a total increase
in the whole area outside of the South of about
250,000 against about 240,000 for the previous decade.
At the same time in the South for the decade
1900 to 1910 an increase of Negroes of only
757,901 as against 1,079,054 from 1890 to 1900, with
an actual decrease in the population of the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
States, Maryland, Kentucky and Tennessee, amounting
to 33,020.</p>

<p>This would seem to indicate a rate of increase in
the South of about ten percent and outside of the
South, in the rest of the United States about twenty-five
percent, up to 1910.</p>

<p>But in connection with the above there is another
fact which is of some importance, and that is the
increase of the entire Negro population of the
United States, in 1900 amounting to 8,849,789, as
exhibited by the Census of 1910 was 351,029 less
than the increase of the 7,488,788 Negroes in the
United States in 1890 to 1900.</p>

<p>What has caused the difference?</p>

<p>The not unnatural but wholly unsatisfactory suggestion
of the Census authorities, that the discrepancy
is due to the errors of others Censuses, should
be received with politeness coming from such
efficient workers; but can hardly be taken at its
face value. After all the Censuses are our safest
guides, and there is not much reason for thinking
one so very much better than another.</p>

<p>Again, there is a class of reasoners prone to take
to themselves the somewhat comforting conclusion
that the Negroes may be moving into the North and
West from the South; but that they cannot live there
and die out; to clinch the argument, they point to
Canada, where it is asserted just about and after
the war a great number of Negroes had settled in
Ontario, and certain it is that by the official Census
of Canada for 1911, the Negro population had decreased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
from 17,437 in 1901 to 16,877 in 1911.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
Yet there are other facts and circumstances leading
to speculations affording explanation of a part of
the loss.</p>

<p>From 1900 to 1920, there passed over into Canada
from the United States some 1,318,834 citizens of
the latter country, some of whom have been Negroes,
how many mulattoes, not designated.</p>

<p>It is true that, as Negroes, not more than 383 so
classified entered Canada up to 1911, and only 13
during the fiscal year 1910-1911;<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> but many more
under the classification “citizens of the United
States;” must have entered in the light of the following
newspaper comments:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Winnipeg, Man. February 24, 1911. The Dominion Government
today decided to stop the immigration of Negroes
from the United States, and stopped at the boundary a party
which intended to go to Western Canada.”</p>
</div>

<p>By subsequent and fuller accounts it appeared
this party numbering 200 were finally permitted to
go on and settle, the correspondent of the London
Times, writing to this paper as follows, from Toronto:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There has been some discussion in Parliament and in the
Press over the arrival in Western Canada of 200 Negroes,
who will settle in the free homestead lands in the Athabasca
Landing district, north of Edmonton. It is said the movement
threatens to become formidable and within the year
5,000 Negroes may seek homes in the Peace River Country.
This, however, is probably an exaggeration, arising out of
the alarm which the invasion has excited. The 200 Negroes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
who have just arrived entered the country of Emmerson in
the Province of Manitoba, and were subjected to rigorous
examination by the Immigration officials, but, under the
law, none of them could be refused admission. All had
money, all were in good health and apparently of good moral
standing. The least that any head of a family possessed
in money was $300, and they brought also household effects
and farm implements. A similar party of 200 came from
Oklahoma to Canada over a year ago, and settled in the
neighborhood of Athabasca Landing, where they seem to
have prospered, and to have proved acceptable to the country.”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The correspondent went on to observe that refusal
of homesteads might arouse “feeling in Washington”
and also fail to meet “the approbation of the
Canadian people.” But he thought, if it was the beginning
of a formidable movement from the Southern
States, there would certainly be a demand for
as vigorous regulations as could safely be devised
to prevent or limit Negro immigration. From
Washington came the news item that “if it appeared
that the Canadian Government had decided to bar
American citizens because of their color, the State
Department would protest”, and later it was asserted
that by representations to American railways
interested in the movement, it had been stopped.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>In the light of the actual decline in the very small
number of Negroes in Canada’s population, dropping
from 17,437 in 1901, out of a total of 5,371,315 inhabitants,
to 16,877 out of a total of 7,206,643 in
1911, the alarm and excitement over this “invasion”
is absolutely incomprehensible. Yet there is a possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
explanation in the following speculation. The
Indians in Canada in 1901 numbered, with the half
breeds, 127,914; presumably without, in 1911, they
numbered only 105,492. At the same time two
origins, “various” and “unspecified,” increased from
32,999 to 165,655, and it is not at all impossible that
among these 165,655 we may find many mulatto
“invaders,” as it is scarcely possible, no matter how
prolific the Indian half-breeds may have proved
themselves to be, that they could have supplied more
than twenty percent of the increase of 132,656,
whose origin were not disclosed in 1911.</p>

<p>Sir Harry Johnston’s estimate of the Negro and
Negroid population for Canada in 1910 was 30,000.
It may well have been much more.</p>

<p>Now, of the 4,880,009 Negroes in the United
States in 1870, not more than 584,049 could be
classed as mulattoes; while of the 9,827,763 colored
of 1910, 2,050,686 are so classed;<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> it, therefore, appears
as if miscegenation is preceding at a pretty
rapid rate, the mulattoes increasing just about twice
as fast as the entire colored population; but while
the proportion of mulattoes in the Northern colored
population is still much larger than it is in the
Southern population, the increase of the mulattoes
of the South is about four times as great as at the
North. Under these conditions it would be amusing,
if it were not tragic to hear the average Southerner,
who thinks he thinks about the subject, placidly
declare that his objection to the diffusion of
the Negro in the United States is that, outside of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
the South, they amalgamate with the whites. Of
course it is not pretended that this tremendous difference
in the increase of this class in the two sections
is due entirely to a greater amount of miscegenation
between whites and colored in the South
than at the North, for there is no way of ascertaining
how many of the mulattoes of the North
have in the last ten years passed on into Canada as
“Unspecified” or “Various” in the “Origin”; but
making every allowance which reasonably may be
made, it does not seem as if there is any greater
degree of miscegenation at the North than at the
South, if there is as much; while the North possesses
in Canada a safety valve, which practically insures
that region from any serious injury from Negro
immigration. How unfortunate, therefore, it is,
that it has not occurred sooner to the Negro leaders,
to preach the advantages to be derived from the
members of their race in moving out to some degree
from the South into the West.</p>

<p>Seventeen years after his famous advice—“Cast
down your bucket where you are,” Booker T.
Washington gave a glance Westward as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are more than 270,000,000, acres of unused and
unoccupied land in the South and West. In fact one-half
of the land of the South and two thirds of the land of the
West is still unused. Now is the time for us to become the
owners and users of our share of the land, before it is too
late.”<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Had Washington directed one-half of the phenomenal
energy he exhibited in the eighteen years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
of his prominence in endeavoring to keep the Negroes
in the South, towards assisting them in obtaining
their share of the land in the West, what
progress might they not have made?</p>

<p>Eighteen years ago, before the great world problem
of color had arisen, there was nothing to chill
the zeal of the British Negrophilist; but in South
Africa the British Negrophobe is increasing in numbers
and his influence is also being felt in Canada.
Still there are opportunities for the Negro yet, if
the leaders of the race will only awaken to the necessities
of diffusion. But time and tide wait for no
man.</p>

<p>As has been attempted to be shown, the idea, not
unreasonably entertained soon after the war between
the States, that there was apt to be with time,
a greater and greater increase of Negro population
in the five Southern States, considered as the Black
Belt, is no longer tenable.</p>

<p>Immediately after the war the Negroes were in
a majority of 19,808 in this belt of contiguous States,
which the processes and excesses of Reconstruction
did raise to 168,965, discernable four years after its
overthrow. But by 1890 this Negro majority had
been reduced to 150,661 and by 1900 to 92,610. In
the following decade this black majority through
white immigration and black emigration, was replaced
by a white majority in the so called Black
Belt of 423,717; which now has risen to over a million
and a quarter. The increase of whites has been
greatest in the two States in the center of the belt.
In the State of Alabama from the conclusion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
war, the increase of the white majority has been
steady and continuous, rising from 45,874 in 1870
to 320,566 in 1910 and to 546,980 in 1920. The increase
of the white majority in Georgia was less
rapid. Reconstruction had cut down the white majority
of 93,884 to 81,773 by 1870, but from the
overthrow of Reconstruction it rose to 254,849 in
1910, and has now reached 482,749. Louisiana’s
Negro majority of 2,114 in 1870, Reconstruction had
raised to 28,701 by 1880, but in the forty years
which have followed, it has now become 396,354
whites in excess of blacks.</p>

<p>In the other two States progress has been slower.</p>

<p>South Carolina, laden with Negroes to the very
gunwales by the subjects of “King Cotton,” emerged
from the storm of war with a Negro majority of
126,147, which Reconstruction speedily increased in
“The Prostrate State” to 213,229 by 1880, a number
so far beyond her small white population, that
even with a decreasing rate of increase, the black
majority had increased by 1890 to 226,926, the decrease
of which in 1900 was barely perceptible; but
by 1910 had fallen to 156,681 and in 1920 was still
further reduced to 45,941. And even Mississippi,
whose Negro majority rose steadily from 31,305
in 1870, to 266,430 in 1900, dropped in 1910 to
223,338, which by 1920 had fallen to 81,222. This is
in all probability due to the migration which Carlyle
McKinley predicted in 1889, although Hoffman, who
published a painstaking work in 1896, thinking to
establish that the Negro was dying out, as “in the
Northern States the colored race does not hold his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
own, for the deaths out number the births,” yet concluded
that the Negro was—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“in the South as a permanent factor, with neither the ability
nor the inclination to leave.”<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>
</div>

<p>As in the North and West the numbers of the
Negroes have since 1870 to 1920 risen from 250,000
to 1,550,000 and in the South during the same time
from 4,585,000 to 8,990,000, the two assertions above
do not hang together.</p>

<p>When we consider the view advanced by that great
writer, the author of “The American Commonwealth”,
we find it very difficult for him to shake
himself loose from the impression that the Negro
must remain in the South, and that it is best that
he should, although what he says, himself, would
seem to disprove the assertion. He finds first evidently
by consideration of the census figures up to
1900, that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is thus clear that the Negro center of population is
more southward and that the African is leaving the colder,
higher and drier lands for regions more resembling his
ancient seats in the Old World.”<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Carlyle McKinley, with more prophetic ken, eleven
years earlier foresaw this, but also beyond what is
shown above, that from this region the Negro would
move out, North and West.</p>

<p>Mr. Bryce finds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In these hot lowlands the Negro lives much as he lived
on the plantations in the old days, except that he works
less, because a moderate amount of labor produces enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
for his bare subsistence ... he is scarcely at all in contact
with any one above his own condition. Thus there are
places, the cities especially, where the Negro is improving
industrially because he has to work hard and comes into
constant relation with the whites; and others where he need
work very little, and where being left to his own resources,
he is in danger of relapsing into barbarism.”</p>
</div>

<p>The writer lays it down specifically:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Contact with the whites is the chief condition for the
progress of the Negro. Where he is isolated or where he
greatly outnumbers the whites, his advance will be retarded....
Yet he is often no better off at the North where
the white laborers may refuse to work with him and where
he has no more chance than in the South of receiving, except
in very exceptional cases, any sort of social recognition
from any class of whites, while in the cities everywhere he
is met by the competition of the generally more diligent and
more intelligent whites. So the Negro is after all better
off in the South and on the land, than anywhere else.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Contrasting the views of Booker Washington and
DuBois, he finds a cultured group which declare
they do not seek social equality with the whites, yet
in spite of the fact, stressed, that where he is isolated
or where he greatly outnumbers the whites, his advance
will be retarded, a condition of the South,
building upon such a foundation, Mr. Bryce does
not hesitate to declare, that because, at the North,
“the white laborers may refuse to work with him
... the Negro is after all better at the South.”</p>

<p>Apparently in the view of this great Englishman,
the risk of a relapse into barbarism is not as serious
a matter to the Negro, as exposure to the cold
shoulder or angry scowl of a white laborer; and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
he dismisses the Negro and his future with an attempt
to epitomize the philosophy of Dr. Washington
into what is really Mr. Bryce’s imperious conviction,
viz, that there is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“no use in resisting patent facts, that all that the Negro
can do at present, and the most effective thing, that, with a
view to the future, he could do, is to raise himself in intelligence,
knowledge, industry, thrift, whatever makes for
self help and self respect.”</p>
</div>

<p>But even while this epitome was appearing in
print for the first time, the inability of the great
author to fully plumb the depths of Dr. Washington’s
political philosophy was shown by the New
York Age, the leading colored paper of the United
States, which, upon the nomination of Mr. Taft
for the presidency in 1908, published what was asserted
to be the facsimile of the telegram sent him
by Dr. Washington, to the effect that he expected to
see him elected and by his (Washington’s) people,
as no doubt he was, to a very great degree, by their
votes in the Northern States.</p>

<p>If then—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“a systematic effort has been made to settle colored people
in Indiana, to hold that State in the Republican column”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>—</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">surely a way had been found for the colored man to
do more than Mr. Bryce thought he could. He can
move out of that section where in mass his vote was
destructive into that one, in which it is sought, and
there cast it for what he deems his interest.</p>

<p>If in 1908, the Negroes moved into the North for
the purpose of supporting Mr. Taft and defeating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
Mr. Bryan, they did what they had a right to do,
and under conditions which made it hardly possible
that it could inflict much damage, even if the vote
was cast more as a commodity of merchandise is
disposed of, than as an exercise of a free man’s
franchise; for no matter for whom cast, it could
hardly swamp the opposition. When, as a mass of
delegates from the South, however, four years later
in 1912, the Negroes assisted Mr. Taft’s friends in
party convention assembled, to secure for him the
renomination for the presidency, against the wish
of one, deemed by many as the most powerful cleansing
factor of the Republican party, the evil effects
flowing from so great and determinative occupation
with politics by the Negroes of the South, became
so apparent to many earnest Northern men, that the
reported view of Mr. Roosevelt, as to the distinction
between the exercise of the right by the Negro in
the South and out of it, did not seem so strange.</p>

<p>To extreme Negrophiles, of course, it is merely an
indication of the marvelous progress of what is
called the Southern “color psychosis.” It is in fact
one of the many illustrations constantly appearing,
of the realization of the fact that, when invested too
swiftly and fully with power and privilege, backward
people are apt to stumble; and in this connection
it might be well to consider the morality of the
Negroes of South Africa, thirteen years after the
overthrow of the Boer republics, under whose rule
they had been protected from the oppression of the
more savage members of their race; but nevertheless
kept in a distinctly menial condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>A report appearing in 1913 in that country is, in
itself, some evidence of the value of the suggestion
made by the author of this work to the great New
York paper, which in 1890 had invited ideas to be
suggested to it.</p>

<p>An impartial study of the color psychosis of these
two little white republics in a sea of blacks, cut off
to a great degree from the influence of European
and American ideas, as they were in 1890; but
evolving not only a people, stated by the London
Lancet to be the finest physical specimens in the
world; but also a Botha and a Smuts, surely must
have been of great educational value to the United
States. Here is the report ten years after South
African Reconstruction:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cape Town, June 9, 1913: The report of the committee
appointed to inquire into the assaults by natives on white
women shows that the misgivings on the subject were only
too well founded. The figures during the twelve years (from
the period of the overthrow of the republics to the date)
rise from a total of eleven convictions in 1901 to seventy in
1912. The increase is most in Transvaal, next in Natal and
then in Cape Colony. Generally speaking the Commission
attributes the increase mainly to diminished respect on the
part of the natives for the whites, this in turn being due to
a variety of causes, chiefly to the contact of natives with
degenerate or criminal whites. A potent cause of this
criminality and degeneracy on the Rand is the illicit liquor
traffic. The Commission also uses extremely plain language
regarding what is described as the almost criminal carelessness
of white women in the treatment of their native house-boys.
It has been the custom to allow them to bring the
early coffee into the bedroom of the mistress of the house
and that of her daughters, where he has an opportunity
of seeing them in a state of undress they would not dream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
of showing themselves in to a white man. The Commission
states that cases, though few, have undoubtedly occurred, in
which the white mistress or servants have played Potiphar’s
wife to the house boy’s Joseph. In other words charges have
been trumped up. The chief legal recommendation is the
imposition of a penalty on the intercourse of a male black
with a female white or a male white with a female black.”<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Englishman, in 1921 is just commencing to
see some virtue in the Boer who, until very recently,
has shared with the South Carolinian the distinction
of being the most vilified of all people. Like the
South Carolinian, the Boer believes that, between the
races, “familiarity breeds contempt.” Both peoples
hold to their views very tenaciously. No change has
ever induced the white people of South Carolina
to alter their attitude against divorce. Perhaps
this is one of the reasons which has induced the advanced
thinkers of the higher civilizations to generalize
most fiercely against the white inhabitants of
this small State of the Union.</p>

<p>In 1910, Sir Harry Johnston produced his book
“The Negro in the New World.” The author, a
traveler and student, at the suggestion of President
Roosevelt, brought to the consideration of his subject
much knowledge and not a little temper. The
aim of the book is popularity. From a scroll below
the map of the Western Hemisphere, the heads of
Dr. Burghardt DuBois and Booker T. Washington
project, silent witnesses to an entirely colored
United States with the exception of the tips of New
England and Florida; but as all of England, France
and Italy are colored, no reflection is evidently intended.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
In his preface, with amusing naivete, he
confesses:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dealing with slavery under the British, I feel obliged to
show with what terrible cruelties this institution was connected
in the greater part of the British West Indies, and
possibly also in British Guiana before 1834. Nor did these
cruelties cease entirely with the abolition of the Slave Trade
and Slavery. They were continued under various disguises
until they culminated in the Jamaica Revolt of Moratt Bay
in 1865. Since 1868 the history of the British West Indies,
so far as the treatment of the Negro and the colored man is
concerned has been wholly satisfactory, taking into consideration
all the difficulties of the situation.”<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>
</div>

<p>When he reaches that part of his book which is
to show:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How bad was the treatment of the Negro in the Southeastern
States of the Union, between, let us say, 1790 and
1860”—he says—“This story should be written over again,
lest we forget.”<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Evidently there is no need to take into consideration
any “of the difficulties of the situation” in the
Southeastern States of the Union. Sir Harry
Johnston has been called upon to curse the Southeastern
States of the Union, and being a firmer type
of man than Balaam, he does it thoroughly. But
incidentally he exclaims impatiently:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Haiti’ I have tried to show is not as black as she has
been painted.”</p>
</div>

<p>To which he adds the following rich, dark, daub:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For very shame she should cease to make the Negro
race a laughing stock.”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>The author has not proceeded a page in his chapter,
“Slavery in the United States” before he begins
to inveigh against South Carolina and Charleston.
He tells his readers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In South Carolina the condition of the slaves was often
one of great hardship, and the slave laws were very cruel.”</p>
</div>

<p>He writes of slave insurrections in South Carolina
in 1710, 1720, and 1740, and states that in 1760 there
was a slave population of 400,000 in Virginia, South
Carolina and Georgia; but he fails to mention that
during this period these people were all under British
control. He actually makes it a complaint of
South Carolina that: “these were the people so
admired by Gladstone, Kingsley, Huxley and Carlyle.”<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>The more he writes the angrier he gets with South
Carolina:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The election of Abraham Lincoln was the last episode
which decided South Carolina—protagonist of the Slave
Powers and rightly so called, for it has been from first to
last the wickedest of the Slave States—to secede from the
Union.”<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But he cannot keep away from 1740:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was in South Carolina in the first quarter of the
eighteenth century, that life was made unbearable and
short for the unfortunate African, and that being driven to
mad despair, the Negroes broke out in the Charleston revolt
of 1740, and attempted (small blame to them) to slay the
pitiless devils who were their masters.”<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>The truth about this insurrection is as follows.
No insurrection occurred in South Carolina in 1740;
but in 1739, when as Sir Harry Johnston failed to
state, the province was under British control:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An outbreak occurred, undoubtedly instigated by the
Spaniards at St. Augustine. Emissaries had been sent persuading
the Negroes to fly from their masters to Florida,
where liberty and protection awaited them.... At length
on the 9th of September, a number of Negroes assembled
at Stono and began their movement by breaking open a
store, killing two young men who guarded the warehouse and
plundering it for guns and ammunition. Thus provided with
arms they chose one of their number captain and marched
in the direction of Florida with colors flying and drums beating.
On their way they entered the house of Mr. Godfrey,
murdered him, his wife and children, took all the arms in
the house and setting fire to it proceeded to Jacksonborough.
In their march they plundered and burnt every house, killed
the white people, and compelled other Negroes to join them....
For fifteen miles they had spread desolation through all
the plantations on their way. Fortunately having found rum
in some houses and drinking freely of it, they halted and
began to sing and dance. During these rejoicings the militia
came up and took positions to prevent escape, then advancing
and killing some, the remainder of the Negroes dispersed
and fled to the woods. Many ran back to the plantations to
which they belonged in the hope of escaping suspicion of
having joined in the rising; but the greater part were taken
and tried, some of them who had been compelled to join
were pardoned; the leaders suffered death. Twenty one
whites and forty-four Negroes lost their lives in this insurrection.”<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>
</div>

<p>There was no Charleston revolt in 1740.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the Northern colonies the only signal disturbances
were those of 1712 and 1741 at New York, both of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
were more notable for the frenzy of the public than for the
formidableness of the menace.... The rebels to the number
of twenty-three provided themselves with guns, hatchets,
knives and swords and chose the dark of the moon in the small
hours of an April night to set a house afire and slaughter the
citizens as they flocked thither. But their gun fire caused
the Governor to send soldiers from the battery with such
speed that only nine whites had been killed and several others
wounded when the plotters were routed. Six of these killed
themselves to escape capture, but when the woods were beaten
and the town searched next day and an emergency court sat
upon the cases, more captives were capitally sentenced than
the whole conspiracy had comprised.... Of those convicted,
one was broken on the wheel, another hanged alive in
chains, nineteen more were executed on the gallows or at the
stake, one of these being sentenced ‘to be burned with a slow
fire that he may continue in torment for eight or ten hours
and continue burning until he be dead and consumed to
ashes.’”<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>“The commotion in 1741 was a panic among the whites of
high and low degree, prompted in sequel to a robbery and a
series of fires by the disclosures of Mary Burton, a young
white servant concerning her master John Hughson and the
confessions of Margaret Kerry, a young white woman of
many aliases, but most commonly called Peggy, who was an
inmate of Hughson’s disreputable house and a prostitute to
Negro slaves ... Hughson and his wife and the infamous
Peggy were promptly hanged, and likewise John Ury, who
was convicted of being a Catholic priest as well as a conspirator;
and twenty-nine Negroes were sent with similar
speed to the gallows or stake, while eighty others were deported....
Quack and Cuffee, for example, terror stricken
at the stake made somewhat stereotyped revelations; but the
desire of the officials to stay the execution with a view to a
definite reprieve was thwarted by their fear of tumult by the
throng of resentful spectators.”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>In the more scholarly portions of this book, the
author invites comparison with the great work of
Ripley, the American, which unavoidably detracts
from the confidence of the reader in the wealth of
expression of the Englishman. The book is a mass
of information, in which much prejudice is apparent.
When he gets down to advice, the writer informs
the reader that what he regards as “a matter of
crucial importance to the civilized Christian
Negro,”<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Mr. Roosevelt evidently thought non-sense,
for that great American informed him, that
he would never—</p>

to their white fellow citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Sir Harry wished—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“the leaders of the Negro people to inveigh against these
garments (frock coats and silk hats) which only look well
on two white men out of ten, and never look other than ugly
and inappropriate on a person of dark complexion.”<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is hardly necessary to make any great endeavor
to discover the exact meaning of the author’s mouth
filling phrase:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the Imperial destiny of the English speaking peoples
of North America is to be achieved, they must expect to see
their flag or flags covering nationally many peoples of non-Caucasian
race wearing the shadowed livery of the burnished
sun.”<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>
</div>

<p>For while he tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The eleven States of the Secession have remained to
this day (1910) apart from the rest of America in their
domestic policy towards the Negro and people of color with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
any drop of black blood in their veins. Here alone—except
perhaps in the Transvaal, Orange State and Natal of British
South Africa—does the racial composition of a citizen
(and not mere dirtiness, drunkenness, or inability to pay)
exclude him or her from municipal or national privilege and
public conveniences otherwise open to all and paid for by
all.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Yet with all these imperfections in the social acceptance
of the colored people of the United States—imperfections
which with time and patience and according to the
merits of the Negro will disappear—the main fact was evident
to me after a tour through the Eastern and Southern States
of North America; that nowhere in the world—certainly
not in Africa—has the Negro been given such a chance of
mental and physical development as in the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If Sir Harry Johnston, or for the matter of that,
his patron, President Roosevelt, had only been able
to study that neglected and impoverished Negro
seer, the only one of the teachers of his people who
gave his blood for their freedom, proving his faith
by his works and not by mere lip service, the repudiation
of whom by the Negroes and their leaders is
the severest indictment which could be drawn
against the race, they might have been wiser. But
from time immemorial the call to the prophet has
always been: “Prophesy unto us smooth things.”—and
W. Hannibal Thomas having fought in the ranks
of the Union army and lived in the midst of Reconstruction,
knew a little too much, despite his exaltation
of the civilization of New England, and his
criticism of the South’s attempt in 1865 to mould
again its own, apart from slavery, to ever be accepted
by those who had participated in or were
responsible for Reconstruction.</p>

</div>


<p>The American Historical Association founded
about 1889 has accomplished a great work in purifying
the sources from which history has been drawn.
It has stimulated the study of history and has afforded
the field and opportunity for effort. By the
Act of Incorporation it shall report annually its proceedings
and the condition of historical study in
America, to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institute,
who shall communicate to Congress the whole
of such reports or such portion thereof as he shall
see fit.</p>

<p>In the year 1909, the President of the Association,
invited, from certain selected individuals, papers on
the Negro question limited to 1800 words, for one
of the sessions of the Association. This was a limitation
which every white person accepting should
have scrupulously observed and no one should have
accepted who was not willing to exert himself seriously.
Yet the tendency of not a few whites to
allow themselves always a little playfulness whenever
discussing this subject seems ineradicable. To
the one colored scholar, who accepted the invitation,
the occasion afforded an opportunity not to be permitted
to slip by unimproved, and with admirable
nerve, he selected the darkest decade discernible in
the consideration of the subject, as disclosed in the
history of the United States, and addressed himself
to a discussion of “Reconstruction and Its Benefits,”
in a paper of about 10,000 words.</p>

<p>In the disregard which he thereby showed of the
terms of his invitation he was justified by his color<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
and his brains and the merit of his work won for
him the widest dissemination of his view. Like Sir
Harry Johnston’s more elaborate book it is polemical;
but superior in taste and style, being free from
the little querelous snarls with which the Englishman
garnished his treatise; for if there were sneers
in DuBois’s exposition they were couched in language
which passes muster among well bred people;
while the fact that he was in reality an advocate,
with a brief to maintain, accorded him license for
such.</p>

<p>The opening could hardly be improved upon by
any special pleader.</p>

<p>Writing in 1909, he declares:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is danger today that between the intense feeling
of the South and the conciliatory spirit of the North grave
injustice will be done the Negro American in the history of
Reconstruction. Those who see in Negro suffrage the cause
of the main evils of Reconstruction must remember that if
there had not been a single freedman left in the South after
war the problems of Reconstruction would still have been
grave. Property in slaves to the extent of perhaps two
thousand million dollars had suddenly disappeared. One
thousand five hundred more millions representing the Confederate
war debt, had largely disappeared. Large amounts
of real estate and other property had been destroyed, industry
had been disorganized, 250,000 men had been killed
and many more maimed. With this went the moral effect
of an unsuccessful war with all its letting down of social
standards and quickening of hatred and discouragement—a
situation which would make it difficult under any circumstances
to reconstruct a new government and a new civilization.
Add to all this the presence of four million freedmen
and the situation is further complicated.”<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>That the training and the treatment of these ex-slaves
became a central problem of Reconstruction,
he admits; yet claims that three agencies, the Negro
church; the Negro school and the Freedmen’s Bureau
undertook the solution, without which, he maintains,
it would have been far graver. But he absolutely
disregards that product of ante-bellum
Southern civilization then in the South, 132,819<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
free persons of color, many of whom were morally
and mentally well fitted for what the Black Codes
designed to give them, the suffrage. This element
of the Southern population together with the majority
of the House slaves would have probably furnished
a base of about ten per cent of the total
Negro population on which the new civilization
would have been reared, had the South been permitted
to test its plan. Having declared that the
economic condition of the eleven States at the close
of the war was “pitiable, their fear of Negro freedom
genuine,” Dr. DuBois maintains, “yet it was
reasonable to expect from them something less than
repression and utter reaction toward slavery.”</p>

<p>Admitting that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To some extent this expectation was fulfilled: the abolition
of slavery was recognized and the civil rights of owning
property and appearing as a witness in cases in which he
was a party were generally granted the Negro.”<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>—</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">he promptly contradicts his own admission, with
the assertion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Codes spoke for themselves. They have often been
reprinted and quoted. No open minded student can read
them without being convinced that they meant nothing more
nor less than slavery in daily toil.”<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Is this true? Can any student be absolutely open
minded? A seer is a receiver and revealer of truths.
Such a being can possibly approach the consideration
of a subject with an open mind. One may
imagine Socrates so approaching a subject; but by
what process, by what mental cathartic, does one,
who studies, divest his mind of all preconceived
ideas of the subject every time he considers a theory
concerning that which has interested him sufficiently
to lead him to seek to know more of it?</p>

<p>No, the vast mass of us approach those subjects,
when we are sincerely desirous of truth in the spirit
of that individual who exclaimed to Christ—“Lord
I believe, help thou mine unbelief.” When the broken,
beaten South attempted to frame the Codes,
which no Negro has ever been able to consider judicially,
the survivors could not possibly approach the
condition they were in with an open mind. The
greatest mind that has ever considered our great experiment
in government, the French student De Tocqueville
and that strong but shallower mind, that
for so many years had with its resolutions overshadowed
all others in the South, united in the dictum.
Abolition means Africanization for the South.
But the whites of the South were to a great extent
British and Northern Irish in stock. They were
eminently conservative. A stock greater in defeat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
than in victory, as history has shown the British
to be.</p>

<p>To obtain additional strength with which to withstand
the flood of ignorance and incompetence let
loose or about to break loose, they accepted the
leadership of the poor white Andrew Johnson, despite
the repugnance they felt for him, as keen and
lively as any Englishman ever felt for Joe Chamberlain
or Lloyd George or Ramsay McDonald. They
did more. As far as legislation could affect it, they
extended social equality to the least darkened of
the dark race by which they were surrounded. The
political principle, upon which they sought to adjust
themselves to the changed condition, was based
apparently upon the thought that if all the Southern
whites and that proportion of the Colored population
constituting about one-tenth, reasonably the
most elevated in the minds of the theorists, from
the fact that they closest approached the whites in
physical texture, united, such union must strengthen
the rulers even as it weakened the ruled. Dr. DuBois
therefore is quite wrong when he intimates
with some generosity, that the Black Codes were
framed under hasty excitement, in declaring:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To be sure it was not a time to look for calm, cool,
thoughtful action on the part of the white South.”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>
</div>

<p>No, whatever may eventually be found to be the
character of the Black Codes of the beaten South,
they bear upon their faces the imprint of cool, calm,
thoughtful action. Even the most cursory consideration
of them will disclose that they were framed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
more for the irresponsible freedman than the freedmen
in general; for instance, if the freedman owned
a farm or had a permit, the possession of gun, pistol
or sword, otherwise forbidden, was not denied. On
the other hand the inhibition of the right of sale or
barter of domestic produce did not apply to the
Negro generally; but to the servant under contract
with a master engaged in husbandry, and not even
then, if the servant had written evidence from such
master, or from a person authorized by him, or from
a District Judge, whose oath specifically required
him to do what was required by law “without prejudice
for or against color.”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> In addition the servant
was given the right to—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Depart from the master’s service for an insufficient supply
of wholesome food; for an unauthorized battery upon
his own person or one of his family, not committed in defense
of the person, family, guests or agents of the master,
nor to prevent a crime or aggravated misdemeanor.”<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The law went further. It gave the servant the
right of departure coupled with the right to recover
wages due for service rendered up to the time of
his departure, for any—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“invasion of the conjugal rights of the servant, or his (employer’s)
failure to pay wages when due.”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>
</div>

<p>And not even the death of the master terminated
the contract, without the assent of the servant, for
the enforcement of which the servant had a lien as
high as rent. And when wrongfully discharged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
the servant was entitled to recover wages for the
whole period of service, according to the contract.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>That the master was given the right to administer
corporal punishment to the servant under some
conditions cannot be denied; but the phraseology of
the South Carolina Act is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The master may moderately correct servants who have
made contracts and are under eighteen years of age”—<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
but it also commanded:</p>

<p>“It shall also be his duty to protect his servant from violence
by others in his presence.”<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Yet it specifically provided that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Corporal punishment is intended to include only such
modes of punishment, not affecting life or limb, as are used
in the army or navy of the United States, adapted in kind
and degree to the nature of the offense.”<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Finally, not to prolong the discussion, when we
note that the servant was not liable civilly or criminally
for any act done by the command of the
master, for any tort on the master’s premises<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> and
that the former slave holder was not permitted to
dispossess the non paying helpless former slave, for
a year and a month from the occupancy of dwellings
belonging to the former master, but occupied without
any return by the former slave,<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and what
elaborate provisions in detail were made for the care
of such in his or her helpless condition, we will find
that we look in vain in England, old or New, for
such humanitarian legislation, at this date. Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
then were the Codes overthrown? Dr. DuBois is
prejudiced and naturally so. He is not as well informed
as he deems himself to be; but he desires to
be fair and just; and so we have from this, the
most cultured member of the colored race in the
United States, the real reason for “Reconstruction
and its Benefits.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The difficulties that stared Reconstruction politicians in
the face were these: (a) They must act quickly. (b) Emancipation
had increased the political power of the South by
one sixth; could this increased political power be put in
the hands of those, who in defense of slavery had disrupted
the Union?”<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>
</div>

<p>So, the terrific losses, which he himself itemizes
were not enough. The beaten South was to be
manacled. And how does he picture the victors in
that dreadful hour?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There might have been less stealing in the South during
Reconstruction without negro suffrage but it is certainly
highly instructive to remember that the mark of the thief
which dragged its slime across nearly every great Northern
state and almost up to the Presidential chair could not certainly
in those cases be charged against the vote of black
men. This was the day when a national secretary of war
was caught stealing, a Vice President presumably took bribes,
a private Secretary of the President, a chief clerk of the
Treasury and eighty-six government officials stole millions
in the whisky frauds, while the Credit Mobilier filched fifty
millions and bribed the government to an extent never revealed;
not to mention less distinguished thieves like
Tweed.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>Remember this is not a Southerner, black or
white; but the most cultured of Northern colored
men, who so describes the conquering East from
which he sprang.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to state more comprehensively
in less space than that in which Dr. DuBois
describes the effects of Congressional Reconstruction:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When incompetency gains political power in an extravagant
age the result is widespread dishonesty.”<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But he palliates this with the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The dishonesty in the Reconstruction of the South was
helped on by three circumstances:</p>

<p>1. The former dishonesty of the political South.</p>

<p>2. The presence of many dishonest Northern politicians.</p>

<p>3. The temptation to Southern politicians at once to profit
by the dishonesty and to discredit Negro government.</p>

<p>4. The poverty of the negro.”<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He fails to furnish any authorized evidence of the
first; but the three last should be accepted as in some
degree exculpatory of the Negroes.</p>

<p>There is something almost pathetic in Dr. DuBois’s
description of the Negroes’ contribution to
Reconstruction:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Undoubtedly there were many ridiculous things connected
with Reconstruction governments: the placing of ignorant
field hands who could neither read nor write in the Legislature,
the golden spitoons of South Carolina, the enormous
printing bill of Mississippi—all these were extravagant and
funny, and yet somehow to one who sees beneath all that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
bizarre, the real human tragedy of the upward striving of
down-trodden men, the groping for light among people born
in darkness, there is less tendency to laugh and gibe than
among shallower minds and easier consciences. All that is
funny is not bad.”<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>
</div>

<p>And this he follows with what he means to be an
indictment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“—the greatest stigma on the white South is not that it
opposed Negro suffrage and resented theft and incompetence,
but that when it saw the reform movement growing
and even in some cases triumphing, and a larger &amp; a larger
number of black voters learning to vote for honesty and
ability, it still preferred a Reign of Terror to a campaign
of education, and disfranchised Negroes instead of punishing
rascals.”<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>
</div>

<p>When we reflect that the Confederate generals,
Wade Hampton, Kershaw and McGowan, as has been
shown, all supported the revolt of Delany, Cain and
William Hannibal Thomas, against Chamberlain
and R. B. Elliott in 1874 in South Carolina, and that
in the columns of “The Crisis,” today, Elliott is
eulogized as a great representative of the colored
race; while no mention has ever appeared of those
two Northern Negroes who most conspicuously opposed
the evils of Reconstruction, Martin Delany
and William Hannibal Thomas, we can only acquit
Dr. DuBois of insincerity on the ground of rank
carelessness and immovable prejudice.</p>

<p>The summing up of this very interesting defense
of Reconstruction and plea for the Negroes as lawmakers
is unquestionably an able presentation:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Reconstruction constitutions practically unaltered were
kept in:</p>

<p>
Florida, 1868-1885             17 years<br>
Virginia, 1870-1902            32 years<br>
South Carolina, 1868-1895      27 years<br>
Mississippi, 1868-1890         22 years<br>
</p>

<p>Even in the case of States like Alabama, Georgia, North
Carolina and Louisiana, which adopted new constitutions to
signify the overthrow of Negro rule, the new constitutions
are nearer the model of the Reconstruction document than
they are to the previous constitutions. They differ from
the Negro Constitution in minor details, but very little in
general conception. Besides this there stands on the statute
books of the South today law after law passed between
1868 and 1876 and which has been found wise effective and
worthy of preservation. Paint the carpet bag governments
and Negro rule as black as may be, the fact remains that the
essence of the revolution which the overturning of the Negro
Governments made was to put these black men and their
friends out of power. Outside of the curtailing of expenses
and stopping of extravagance, not only did their successors
make few changes in the work which these Legislatures
and Conventions had done, but they largely carried out their
plans, followed their suggestions, and strengthened their institutions.
Practically the whole new growth of the South
has been accomplished under laws which black men helped
to frame thirty years ago. I know of no greater compliment
to Negro suffrage.”<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It would be idle to deny that these Reconstruction
constitutions were other than most effective.</p>

<p>William Hannibal Thomas, who might be fitly described
as in charge of the rear guard when the
Negro government fell in South Carolina and who
has criticised the Black Codes even more severely
than Dr. DuBois, states:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Constitutions of the Reconstructed States were
framed by white men under the direction and with the approval
of the best legal intelligence of America.”<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>
</div>

<p>They were framed to complete the conquest of the
overthrown States, Dr. Dodd puts it thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The cause of the planters had gone down in irretrievable
disaster. For forty years they had contended with their
rivals of the North, and having staked all on the wager of
battle they had lost. Just four years before they had entered
with unsurpassed zeal and enthusiasm upon the gigantic
task of winning their independence. They had made the
greatest fight in history up to that time. Lost the flower
of their manhood and wealth untold. They now renewed
once and for all time their allegiance to the Union, which
had up to that time been an experiment, a government of
uncertain powers. More than three hundred thousand lives
and not less than four billions of dollars had been sacrificed
in the fight of the South. The planter culture, the semi-feudalism
of the ‘Old South’ was annihilated, while the industrial
and financial system of the East was triumphant.
The cost to the North had been six hundred thousand lives
and an expense to the governments, State and National, of
at least five billion dollars. But the East was the mistress
of the United States, and the social and economic ideals of
that section were to be stamped permanently upon the
country.”<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The war having ended in a complete conquest of
the South and a sentimental control of the vigorous
West, expanded by the East as it exploited the broken
South; through the destruction of the codes and
the imposition of Congressional Reconstruction, the
whites of the South were welded into a new mass,
cruder and tougher and not unnaturally quite inimical
to the Negro who had been made to rule over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
them, until by revolutionary methods they had overthrown
such. That they, the Negroes, and the Western
whites had all been subjected to the control of
the East as thoroughly as economic laws could subject
them to it, was not for decades appreciated in the South or West.</p>

<p>Had Lincoln not been assassinated and had he remained
true to his Western ideals, he would have
been broken on the wheel of capitalism as relentlessly
as was his great Southern successor, who struck
down Germany in her hour of triumph. But Lincoln
was spared that test and died without realizing
the entire measure of his service to the Union and
the whites who inhabited it; for to him the Negroes
were a negligible quantity, despite all the phrases
with which he utilized them, in his purpose of preserving
the Union. Indeed it was not until the
fountains of the great deep were broken in the
World War, that the inevitable consequences of
emancipation forced themselves upon public opinion,
and, in this connection, a small episode, of the above
related meeting of the American Historical Association
in 1909, throws some light upon the state of
mind of the East at that date.</p>

<p>At the same meeting in which Dr. DuBois read
his bold, elaborate and interesting defense of Congressional
Reconstruction, the author of this study
submitted, on request, a paper on the Negro question,
in accordance with the limitations, which, while
accepted and edited for publication by the Board,
was not permitted publication in the Report of the
Historical Association, Mr. Charles D. Walcott having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
the power to exclude it from such, and using
the power. That the skeleton piece of 1750 words
was to some slight degree critical of the East is not
to be denied; but if the Eastern scholars rose above
their prejudices when presented with truth why
could not the official? The gist of the little paper
when printed does not appear very inflammatory.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Says a distinguished Northern writer—‘The North is
learning every day by valuable experiences that there are
vast differences in political capacity between the races.’ Certainly
nothing has afforded such an opportunity for the
North to acquire these valuable experiences day by day, as
the diffusion of the Negroes throughout the Union.
Meanwhile as the masses in the South are reduced the Negroes
will not constitute, to the degree they now do, the
criminal class; their good qualities must become more noticeable
and their bad ones excite less that intense or contemptuous
regard, which has, in the minds of many Southern
men, made Negro and criminal almost synonymous terms.
The war made the Negro question a national question, and
it is too late to say—‘the man of the South must be trusted
to work out this (the evolution of the Negro race to higher
conditions) in his own good time’ and that ‘he is charged with
the burden and must bear it.’ That is a sectional attitude
just to neither the Negro nor the white man of the South.
In time and with greatly reduced numbers of the Negroes
about him, the Southern white man may change the view,
which inheritance of ideas almost forces him to hold, viz.,
that the Negro is essentially servile; but that is his sentiment
today; and while, therefore, he may be best fitted to rule
him as such, he is not constituted to assist him in the evolution
to a higher condition. As they spread out, the Negroes
must come more and more in contact with all grades of our
civilization and from such draw the lessons best adapted to
their own development. The sentiment therefore, which
would deny them this; which would seek to confine the
masses to the South, deciding for them that it is their natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
home and having but little sympathy for them beyond the
pale, is in my opinion, the greatest obstacle to their advancement
and, to some degree, a cause of moral deterioration
of the higher race.”<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But while Dr. DuBois and the author of this
study, in response to the invitation of Dr. Hart, before
the historians of the United States were discussing,
each in his own way, a subject they thought
of some importance, it is of interest to consider
what was occupying the mind of the wisest and most
neglected Negro in the United States, at the same
time. About the same date William Hannibal
Thomas wrote to the author of this study:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has long been my dream to see all the railroads under
one management. Therefore had I the influence and cooperation
of others, I would procure a charter from the Congress
of the United States creating a National Railway Company
capitalized at fifteen billion of dollars and empowered to
issue bonds for a like amount. Five great subdivisions
would be created. All south of the Potomac river and east
of the Mississippi would constitute the Southern division.
New England the Eastern division. New York and the
states north and east of the Mississippi, would form the
central division. Westward of that great river there would
be a northern and southern Pacific division. Such in brief
is the scheme I have in mind and, as an economical factor
in National uplift, I know of but one other thing that would
surpass it.”<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We might measure the scope of this Negro’s dream
in the autumn of 1909, by the following news item
of April 17, 1923, which apparently was only another
dream:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Legislation to make affective the plans being worked
out by the interstate commerce commission for consolidation
and regional supervision of the railroad systems of the
country will be undertaken in the next Congress, Chairman
Cummins of the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee
said today, after a discussion of the railroad problem
with President Harding—‘I think consolidation for the railway
system as initiated in the transportation act is the only
means of gaining the efficiency that the country requires
of the railroads,’ said Senator Cummins. Moreover it seems
to me to be the only method of bringing down freight rates
on commodities on which the rate must be lowered.”<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Whatever difference of opinion may exist amongst
railway experts as to the merits of the legislation
concerning railroads which the Iowa senator has
made his name synonymous with, few doubt his
knowledge. Yet he would seem to be just about
fourteen years behind the neglected Ohio Negro,
whose opportunities were restricted to two sessions
of the South Carolina legislature in Reconstruction
days. Is there anything that has ever been resolved
with regard to railroads better calculated to serve
the general public, than that introduced by Thomas,
when opposing the most brilliant of the Carpet Baggers,
Daniel H. Chamberlain, in 1874?—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“VIII. We hold that all franchises granted by the State
should be subservient to the public good; that charges for
travel and freight should be equitable and uniform and no
unjust discrimination be made between through and local
travel.”<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Both conventions had to subscribe to that; but if
it represented the views of Daniel H. Chamberlain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
the Reformers under Thomas and others must be
credited with some influence in turning him from his
earlier views on railroads, when he was the legal
guardian of the State.</p>

<p>Observe him, fresh from the East.</p>

“Office of the Attorney General,<br>
Columbia, S. C. January 5, 1870.</p>

<p>My dear Kimpton: Parker arrived last evening and spoke
of the G. &amp; C. matter, etc. I told him I had just written you
fully on that matter and also about the old Bk. bills. Do
you understand fully the plan of the G. &amp; C. enterprise? It
is proposed to buy $350,000 worth of the G. &amp; C. Stock. This
with $433,000 of stock held by the State, will give entire control
to us. The Laurens branch will be sold in February by
decree of court and will cost not more than $50,000 and
probably not more than $40,000. The Spartanburg and
Union can also be got without difficulty. We shall then have
in G. &amp; C. 168 miles, in Laurens, 31, and in S. &amp; U. 70 miles—in
all 269 miles—equipped and running—put a first mortgage
of $20,000 a mile—sell the bonds at $85 or $90, and the
balance, after paying all outlays for cost and repairs, is
immense, over $2,000,000. There is a mint of money in this
or I am a fool. Then we will soon compel the S. C. R. R. to
fall into our hands and complete the connection to Asheville,
N. C. There is an infinite verge of expansion of power before
us. Write me fully and tell me every thing you want
done. My last letter was very full. Harrison shall be attended
to at once. I don’t think Neagle will make any
trouble. Parker hates Neagle, and magnifies his intentions.</p>

more than himself and his race, who wished to serve

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p>With the year 1914, the world entered a new era
of thought, for the effect upon civilization of that
great convulsion which afflicted the world in 1914
was felt far beyond the arenas upon which the
World War was fought. The conflict was on too
gigantic a scale for it to be grasped during its waging.
It tested civilization to a supreme degree.
Loosely knit bonds, that in all reason should have
parted under the immense strain to which they were
submitted, held all the tighter under the tugs to
which they were subjected. That portion of humanity
which had least to give, gave with a fullness
beyond the imagination of man. Nothing in all
time has ever equalled the volunteer movement of
the men of Britain and her dominion states. Conscription
might have produced a more efficient army
and less weakened the State; but the great soldier
and greater man, who in the main fashioned the
armies of Britain to the admiration of his country’s
foes, knew that, in that great hour, nothing could
equal the moral effect of that wonderful volunteer
movement. Democracy was put to the test and
rang absolutely true.</p>

<p>So much happened before the United States flung
her immense force into the scale, that an infinitude
of fact has passed from the memory of men. Never
in the history of the world was it more thoroughly
demonstrated, that “Order is (not) heaven’s first
law.” Democracy moved up to the sacrifice unfalteringly.
Autocracy broke under the strain and,
in his own appointed time and in spite of all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
man proposed, God disposed of the event, in a way
no one could have dreamed of. But before the
great Republic of the West intervened, in many
ways the United States was affected, and in none
more profoundly than by the migration of the Negroes
from the South and their diffusion throughout
the country. The war between the States and emancipation
had made this diffusion only a question of
time and it had been progressing with a quickened
and then a retarded flow, during the decades previous
to the Great War; but the war’s great check
on immigration from Europe speeded up the movement.
Lecturing at the University of Chicago in
June, 1916, the author of this study was struck with
the nature of the reception accorded the subject:
“The Readjustment of the Negro to the Social System
of the Sixties,” in which the necessity for diffusion
was stressed.</p>

<p>Active from 1890 to 1900, later, the standard of
living of the Northern Negro had risen, and just as
capital in the North and West had forced out the
English, German and Irish workmen and replaced
them with cheaper and inferior people; so too, the
Northern Negro could not live as cheaply as the
Slav, Greek, Italian and Slovene.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> These in their
turn, however, the World War had been sweeping
away, since the middle of 1914; and, while the sentimental
regard for the Negro’s advancement, which
had been very broad and active a generation earlier,
had gradually become restricted to assisting in fitting
him for a residence in “his natural home, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
South,” the need for the brawn and sinew which
he could supply, being felt in the North and West,
in obedience to its demand, the Negro, for a consideration,
was moving out of “his natural home”;
for the philanthropy of the North, the greatest in
the world, as it draws its supplies from, is to some
degree, subservient to, the commercialism of its
section.</p>

<p>Almost contemporaneously with the lectures in
the great Western city, which is destined to be the
center of Northern Negro opinion, from the metropolis
of the Union came an utterance of immense
importance from the most aggressive, intelligent
and humane publication, spreading out its influence
from the center of American and world finance.</p>

<p>As viewed by The New Republic, the situation in
the summer of 1916 was thus stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the Northern Negro the war in Europe has been of
immense and unexpected advantage. It has shut out the
immigrant who is the Negro’s most dangerous competitor,
has doubled the demand for the Negro’s labor, raised his
wages, and given chances to him, which in the ordinary
course would have gone to white men. If immigration still
lags after the war or is held down by law, the Negro will
secure the great opportunity for which he has been waiting
these fifty years.... In Southern cities, Atlanta, Memphis,
Birmingham, Richmond, Nashville, Savannah, Charleston,
Mobile, Negroes constitute one-third to one-half the population
and more than that proportion of the wage earners and
are given a chance to earn their living, because, without
them, the work of these cities could not be done. In the
city of Philadelphia, on the other hand, Negroes form only
5½ per cent of the population, in Chicago only 2 per cent,
in New York a little less than 2 per cent.... If white
men will not work with them, if the employer is forced to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
choose between a large supply of white labor and a small
supply of Negro labor, he will choose the former.... The
Negro gets a chance to work only when there is no one else....
The wronged are always wrong and so we blame the
Negro. If we are fair, however, we must place the responsibility
of a social effect for those responsible for the cause.
If the Northern Negroes have a higher death rate and
breed a larger proportion of criminals and prostitutes than
do the whites, it is in large part our own fault. We cannot
understand the problems of the Negro in the North unless
we constantly bear in mind the fact of industrial opportunity.
The Northern Negro has the right to vote, the right and
duty to send his children to school, and technically, at least,
many civil and political rights. We do not put him into
Jim Crow cars or hold him in prison camps for private
exploitation. Nevertheless, the pressure upon him is almost
as painful, though not nearly so brutal or debasing, as that
upon the Southern Negro. The Northern Negro is urged
to rise but held down hard.... Immigration after the war
seems likely to be kept down at a low level during several
years or possibly decades.... It is the Negro’s chance, the
first extensive widening of his industrial field since emancipation.”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The fact that this very able statement is not entirely
exact in all its details takes very little from
the value of the presentation of it. As has been disclosed
by Mr. Warne, in his, “Immigrant Invasion,”
the Negro had quite a chance until the decade 1900-1910.
That he did not improve it as fully as he
might have done was due; first, to his ignorance;
second, to his retention for quite a while of servile
instincts; third, to the determination, on the part of
a very considerable and influential portion of the
Northern and Western public, that the Negro must
be kept out of the North and West; and of the controlling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
portion of the Southern public, assisted by
the Republican Supreme Court of the United States,
that he should be kept, as near to the condition of a
serf of the soil in the South, as he could be by those
so restraining him, keeping themselves, meanwhile,
on the windy side of the law; fourth, to an active,
continuous, well financed propaganda, led by the
most influential member of the race, that he should
cling to the South.</p>

<p>Against such forces what could be affected by the
few Southern white men, Carlyle McKinley, Wade
Hampton, and M. C. Butler, as early as 1889, preaching
“Diffusion”?</p>

<p>North and South, in the main for purely selfish
reasons, the force of the country was against diffusion
of the Negro and for banking him in the
South, where he had been so long a slave. For such
a paper, therefore, as <cite>The New Republic</cite>, to advocate
diffusion was a matter of the very first importance.</p>

<p>Continuing the discussion in its issue of July 1,
1916. <cite>The New Republic</cite> declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For the nation as a whole, such a gradual dissemination
of the Negro among all the States would ultimately be of
real advantage. If at the end of half a century, only 50
per cent or 60 per cent instead of 89 per cent of the Negroes
were congregated in the Southern States, it would end the
fear of race domination, and take from the South many of
its peculiar characteristics, which today hamper development.
To the Negro it would be of even more obvious benefit....
For if the Southern Negro finding political and
social conditions intolerable, were to migrate to the North,
he would have in his hand a weapon as effective, as any he
could find, in the ballot box.... Against the opposition of
the preponderant white population, the Southern Negro has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
few defenses. He has no vote, he has no wealth; and as
for the protection of the law, that is a sword held by the
white man with the edge towards the Negro. He cannot
better his condition by political action or armed revolt. His
one defense is to move away.”<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Weighing duly what is urged above, without necessarily
accepting all of it as accurate, is it not apparent,
that, for a Southern white man to argue that
the Negroes should remain in the South, in the
masses in which they now exist there, is an indication
that he refuses to consider anything as beneficial,
which affects industrial conditions he has become
accustomed to? For the Negro so to think
is simply the survival of the servile instinct, which
the bulk of the Southern whites claim is latent in all
Negroes.</p>

<p>To stress the matter a little further, the view of a
Southern and a Northern Negro will be submitted
and contrasted.</p>

<p>The first is the view of a colored man, Rev.
Richard Carroll, who, in 1890, had attracted the attention
of George William Curtis, as has been before
mentioned, by his bold and original utterance,
that Tillman had made the whites as well as the Negroes
readers and thinkers. Some eight years later
this colored man had served as the chaplain of a
colored regiment in Cuba. Later he had occupied
himself with a colored school near Columbia, South
Carolina, and, to some extent, had become, to the
press of the State of South Carolina, the type of the
good Negro, who agrees with the best of the whites.
That is the distinct ear mark of the “Good Negro.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>Describing the departure of the Negroes from
South Carolina in 1916, he states that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hon. H. C. Tillman, son of Senator B. R. Tillman, told me
that in the crowd were one or two of the farm hands that
had signed contracts to work next year, but that he would
not interfere with them.”</p>
</div>

<p>Next he describes the tearful, melodramatic appeal
of a Georgia divine, entreating the Negroes not
to leave the South:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have not treated you right; we are going to do better.
Let us, white and colored unite to solve the race question
on Southern soil. We are in debt to you colored people.
First of all we owe you the Gospel; then we owe you
protection before the law. There will be no more outrages
when we take up this problem, as we should, and solve it by
the Gospel.”</p>
</div>

<p>Having shown the patriotic unselfishness of Captain
Tillman and quoted the wail of the Georgia divine,
the colored educator proceeds to state his own
view:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is the country for the black man; the white people
of the South should offer the proper inducements and protection
before the law to keep the colored people in the
Southland.... It may be as many of our colored people
say: ‘God is in this movement.’ But I believe that if the
colored people of the South had worked together for the last
fifty years for the good of each race and at the same time
each race in its place, we would have had better conditions;
in the South—no lynchings, no cause for lynchings. If the
best people in the South had kept it in the hands of the Gen.
Wade Hampton type, this would have been the greatest
country on earth.”</p>
</div>

<p>Just about fifty years before Carroll’s utterance,
people in the South, to some degree answering to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
Carroll’s description of the Hampton type, framed
the Black Codes, as they thought, “for the good of
each race, and at the same time each race in its
place.” But, after Reconstruction, Wade Hampton
thought diffusion of the Negro was the only remedy.</p>

<p>After detailing cases, where he claimed to know
that Negro men of property had been ordered out of
the State simply because they owned property and
were prosperous, Carroll states that when they came
to him for advice, he advised them to—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“try to get to some other white men in the county or community,
as there are plenty of white men in South Carolina,
who would give justice and protection.”<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Black Codes made this obligatory on all masters
for their servants. The framers of the codes
were raised in the school of politics which Rhett,
in 1850, announced the basic principle of, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Where there is but one race in a community there may
be political equality in rights—but this cannot give equality
in mind, character and condition. Servitude still prevails
in one form or another, from a necessity as stern as the
laws. But when the races are different and one race is
inferior to the other, the inferior race must be exterminated
or fall into such a state of subjection as to present motives
for their preservation to the stronger race.”<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Residence in the South, a considerable time after
maturity, had therefore apparently lessened the independence
of this colored man. He had come, not
unnaturally, to prefer security to independence.</p>

<p>But, in the same year and about the same time,
there appeared in the same paper a temperately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
worded article from the pen of another Negro, also
a minister, R. R. Wright, Jr., residing in Philadelphia,
who had been employed at various times by
the United States Bureau of Labor and the University
of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>He had also, at an earlier date, published an essay
on the Negro Problem, which treats the subject as a
scientific investigation, in which all temper and feeling
is out of place. With regard to the movement
of the Negroes he declared there had been at least
four different migrations of the Negroes from the
South to the North since the war between the States,
and estimating in 1916 that there were then, in that
section, usually called the North but embracing a
considerable portion of the West, he thought, of the
1,600,000 Negroes there, three fourths had been
born in the South. With regard to the number of
Negroes in the North at that date this estimate was
above what the Census of 1920 disclosed; for by it,
the date 1910, there were only 1,059,000 Negroes in
the North and West and therefore, even if they had
increased by 1916 to 1,600,000, three fourths of these
could not have been from the South, even if the
total addition of 541,000 had come from that section,
as of the 1,059,000 in 1910, only forty per cent
were from the South;<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> but whether 40%, 50% or
75% were from the South, Wright believed 80%
of those who had moved up would stay, because he
was confident, the most efficient could compete with
the Slavs and Italians in rough work. Indeed he
claimed it was no uncommon thing to see a Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
foreman over groups of Italians in Pennsylvania.
Having seen the same thing practically as to Negroes
and Spaniards, during the World War the
writer can believe this. Higher wages and better
educational facilities also Wright claimed would
draw the Negro, North and West, and finally he cited
what is in his opinion the most powerful inducement,
for the Negro to move in increasing numbers from
the South to the North:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The opportunity to vote will also tend to hold them.
Politicians are encouraging Negroes to remain; as they
are very generally Republican. Northern Negroes are encouraging
them to stay because it gives them more power;
and after the Negro casts his vote and takes part in political
meetings, he is just like the naturalized foreigner—he
likes it and stays. Of course the white people rule, because
superior intelligence and wealth always rule. But the
black man enjoys being a part of the Government and being
called upon every year to have his “say”.... While there
is no more social equality in the North than there is in the
South, and practically no desire for the same, the longer
the Negro lives there, the opportunities to enjoy himself
according to his means appeal to him. He earns more
money, can live in a better house, buy better clothes, develops
more accomplishments, has more leisure and has more protection
in his enjoyment. Personally, I think it is good
both for the Negroes and for the whites that a million or
two million Negroes leave the South. It will make room for a
large number of foreigners to come to the South and will
tend to divorce the South’s labor problem more widely from
its race problem, and will give it a new perspective. It will
also rob the South of the fear of ‘Negro domination’ and
will give it a chance to give a better expression to our
democratic principles. On the other hand the scattering
the Negroes throughout the country will bring them in touch
with the forces of organized labor in a way to bring them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
better protection, while it will also acquaint the North with
the Negro in such a way as to give it a more intelligent
grasp of our general problem of racial relations.”<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile with views for and views against,
shouted to them, from all sides, the Negroes moved
up from the South to the North and West and to
the great centers of industry, to supply the place of
immigrants and soldiers passed and passing to Europe
for the great war.</p>

<p>To the reading Negro, wherever he was, North or
South in this year just before the entrance of the
great Republic into the greatest war of all time, came
“The New Negro, His Political and Civil Status and
Related Essays,” by William Pickens, Lit. D. Easily
comprehended, popularly composed, they opened
with the usual attack upon the black laws of the
South in the sixties, the author especially singling
out the code of South Carolina for criticism. Of
them generally he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From the standpoint of the Negro’s interests, however,
these laws were ‘black’, not only in name and aim, but in
their very nature. Instead of being the property of a personally
interested master, the Negro was to be converted
into the slave of a much less sympathetic society in general.”<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But strange to say this critic, in 1916, actually
proclaims that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of the greatest handicaps under which the New
Negro lives is the handicap of the lack of acquaintanceship
between him and his white neighbor. Under the former
order, when practically all Negroes were either slaves or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
servants, every Negro had the acquaintance of some white
man; as a race he was better known, better understood and
was, therefore, the object of less suspicion on the part of the
white community.”<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If this was a handicap in 1916, what must it have
been in 1865? Forty one years before this Negro
scholar discovered the handicap, the South, in attempting
to readjust itself to the consequences of
defeat and the overthrow of its industrial system,
had legislated to preserve that acquaintanceship by
a system of apprenticeship, which if it was calculated
to work out the problem very slowly; yet was calculated
to produce something superior even to the
free persons of color that slavery had evolved, a
worthy product which no Negro or Northern scholar
has ever had the patience to think about. Little as
the author of this study knows about the free persons
of color whom the South reared; yet it is not
fair to accuse them of what Pickens is absolutely
justified in stating with regard to the mass of Southern
colored citizens who were the product of Congressional
Reconstruction. Pickens indeed is refreshingly
frank in this respect and so much so that
the Negroes will avoid his book. It will not be found
advertised in any list of the National Association for
the Advancement of the Colored Race. He is dangerously
near William Hannibal Thomas in the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Till this day the Negro is seldom frank to the white man
in America. He says what he does not mean; he means
what he does not say. I have heard Negro speakers address
mixed audiences of white and colored persons and both white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
and black go away rejoicing, each side thinking that the
speaker had spoken their opinions, altho the opinions of
the blacks were very different from those of the whites,
even contradictory. This is one reason for the great misconception
in the white race respecting the desires, ambitions
and sentiments of the black.”<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But in the year which followed that in which
Pickens’s book was published the United States entered
the World War.</p>

<p>Before discussing the effect of that great adventure
upon the Negro minority of one-tenth of the
population of the United States, the force which
swung the whole should have some slight consideration,
and from the pen of a political opponent, the
editor of the greatest Republican paper of the West
this is pictured as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our chief admiration for Mr. Wilson is for the manner
in which he drove the war activities once we were committed.
That determination was evolved from his character.
He used conscription. He furnished the Allies with what
they needed—men, money and materials in the amounts
needed. Weakness at this time might have ruined us. A
man less determined to have his own way, less impervious
to what was said of him, might have flinched at conscripting
soldiers. He might have tried to fight the war with volunteers.
He might even have tried to fight it with money and
materials. He might have tried to spare the nation human
sacrifices or to limit the expenditure of human life. Then
we should have entered a losing war and have been among
the losers, just in time to be in the wreckage. Conscription
was his big decision and whether he realized it or not was his
most dangerous one. Hughes might have had serious draft
riots. From Wilson the people took the draft with hardly
a murmur, and the war was won right then. The President
did not allow the people to draw back from a drop in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
cup. He took their money. He spent it without a thought
for the waste of it. There had to be waste. He put the
United States behind the Allies with a promise of the last
man and the last dollar. It required courage, intelligence
and character; and all the ruggedness and wilfulness of Mr.
Wilson’s temperament served the country as it needed to
be served. Those were the high moments of his career.
He sent 2,000,000 men to France before the astonished Germans
thought that it was possible to do so. He had 2,000,000
in America training camps and more were being drafted.
Then also from the White House came the thunders of
rhetoric which stupefied the German people behind their
armies and disintegrated them in the rear of their fighting
forces. As American divisions put the pressure on German
divisions, Mr. Wilson’s words destroyed the morale of
the German people who had been steadfast; and the war
was won.”<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But he did more, a Southerner, conscious of the
deep prejudices of his own section and against the
protests of many State officials, he determined that
a certain proportion of colored men should have
training as officers; nor did he permit this military
training to be stopped even after the Houston riot,
when for the second time Negro soldiery shot up a
Southern city. Those who were guilty were court
martialed promptly; but to the surprise of not a few
of the Negro aspirants for office, the training of
Negro officers proceeded. Again not quoting from
a friend; but taking a Negro’s statement we note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As many as 1200 men became commissioned officers ...
Negro nurses were authorized by the War Department for
service in base hospitals at six army camps—Funston, Sherman,
Zachary Taylor and Dodge, and women served as canteen
workers in France and in charge of hostess houses in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
the United States. Sixty Negro men served as chaplains,
350 as Y. M. C. A. secretaries and others in special capacities....
In the whole matter of the War the depressing incident
was the Court Martial of sixty-three members of the
Twenty Fourth Infantry, U. S. A. on trial for rioting and
the murder of seventeen people at Houston Texas, August
23rd, 1917. As a result of it thirteen of the defendants
were hanged, December 11th, forty-nine sentences to imprisonment
for life, four for imprisonment for shorter terms
and four were acquitted.”<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>
</div>

<p>President Wilson’s action in this matter was a
vindication of President Roosevelt’s action in the
previous riot at Brownsville and a stern condemnation
of the sentimentalists, white and black whose
strictures upon Roosevelt had led the Negro soldiery
to harbor the amazing idea, that troops of any color
could take the law into their own hands and make
Zaberns in America, on a scale beyond the wildest
imaginations of any War Lord’s minions, in Europe.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p>In the year immediately following the end of the
great World War armed clashes between whites and
Negroes in the United States occurred in the great
cities of the North and West, Washington, Chicago
and Omaha and also in the State of Arkansas.
These race riots drew comment from whites and
Negroes. Prior to these riots in the time of peace,
there had been others during the World War at
Chester and Philadelphia, in the State of Pennsylvania
and one in Illinois at East St. Louis. Both
Dr. DuBois, the president of “The National Association
for the Advancement of the Colored People,”
and the colored minister Wright, whose article on
Negro migration has been alluded to, gave advice.
It is interesting to compare their utterances. The
communication of the minister is first cited.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“To my dear Brethren and Friends:<br>
</p>

<p>Permit me to say this word to you in this time of most
serious anxiety. You have read of the riots in St. Louis,
Philadelphia, and Chester, Pennsylvania during the Great
World War and in Washington and Chicago since the close.
When the facts have been finally sifted, they have always
shown that the colored people did not start these riots. They
were started by whites in every instance. If there are to
be riots in the future I want to say to my people let it be
as it has been in the past, that you shall not be the instigators
of them. It is to the everlasting disgrace of these
Northern cities as it has been of certain Southern cities,
that these riots have been started by whites, and that white
policemen who should be the first to uphold the law have, in
nearly every instance assisted the mobs. Now is the time
for all of us to keep our wits: to do nothing wrong, which
may be any excuse for riot. Let men and women go about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
their work quietly, attending to their business. Keep away
from saloons and places where there is gambling. More
trouble starts in these places than anywhere else. Avoid
arguments. Make no boasts. Make no threats. Attack no
man nor woman without due provocation, and under no circumstances
hurt a child. Don’t tell anybody what the Negroes
are going to do to the whites. For we do not want
war; we want peace. Our safety is in peace. Don’t loaf in
the streets; do not needlessly encounter gangs of white boys.
A gang of boys from 15 to 20 years is generally irresponsible.
A gang of white toughs will delight to ‘jump’ a lone Negro,
especially if they number eight or a dozen and believe the
Negro is unarmed; and it is foolish to give them the chance.
In trading as nearly as possible get the right change before
paying your bill; know what you want, where you can trade
with your own people, where you are not liable to get into
a dispute. Don’t go to white theatres, white ice cream
places, white banks or white stores, where you can find
colored to serve you just as well. In other words don’t
spend your hard earned money where you are in danger of
being beaten up. Don’t carry concealed weapons—its against
the law. Now I am not urging cowardice. I am urging common
sense. I am urging law and order. Protect your home,
protect your wife and children, with your life, if necessary.
If a man crosses your threshold after you or your family, the
law allows you to protect your home even if you have to
kill the intruder. Obey the law but do not go hunting for
trouble. Avoid it. Do not be afraid or lose heart because
of these riots. They are merely symptoms of the protest
of your entrance into a higher sphere of American citizenship.
They are the dark hours before morning which have
always come just before the burst of a new civic light.
Some people see this light and they provoke these riots endeavoring
to stop it from coming. But God is working.
Things will be better for the Negro. We want full citizenship
ballot, equal school facilities and everything else. We
fought for them. We will have them; we must not yield.
The greater part of the best thinking white people, North
and South know we are entitled to all we ask. They know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
we will get it. In their hearts they are for us though they
may fear the lower elements who are trying to stir up
trouble to keep us from getting our rights. But they will
fail just as they failed to keep us from our freedom. God
is with us. They cannot defeat God. So I say to you stand
aside, stand prepared, provoke no riot; just let God do
his work. He may permit a few riots just to force the
Negroes closer together. He lets the hoodlums kill a few
in order to teach the many that WE MUST GET TOGETHER.
But he does not mean that we shall be defeated—if
we trust him. Let us learn the lesson He is
teaching us. Remember a riot may break out in any place.
Let pastors caution peace, prayer and preparedness. Let us
provoke no trouble. Let us urge our congregations to keep
level heads and do nothing that is unlawful.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The appeal of DuBois is more dramatic:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Brothers we are on the Great Deep. We have cast off on
the vast voyage which will lead to Freedom or Death. For
three centuries we have suffered and cowered. No race ever
gave Passive Resistance and Submission to Evil longer, more
piteous trial. Today we raise the terrible weapon of Self
Defense. When the murderer comes he shall no longer
strike us in the back. When the armed lynchers gather,
we too must gather armed. When the mob moves we propose
to meet it with bricks and clubs and guns. But we
must tread here with solemn caution. We must never let
justifiable self defense against individuals become blind and
lawless offense against all white folk. We must not seek
reform by violence. We must not seek vengeance. Vengeance
is Mine saith the Lord; or to put it otherwise—only
infinite Justice and Knowledge can assign blame in this
poor world and we ourselves are sinful men, struggling desperately
with our own crime and ignorance. We must defend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
ourselves, our homes, our wives and children against
the lawless without stint or hesitation; but we must carefully
and scrupulously avoid on our own part bitter and unjustifiable
aggression against anybody. The line is difficult
to draw. In the South the Police and Public Opinion
back the mob and the least resistance on the part of the
innocent black victim is nearly always construed as a lawless
attack on society and government. In the North the
Police and the Public will dodge and falter, but in the end
they will back the Right when the truth is made clear to
them. But whether the line between just resistance and
angry retaliation is hard or easy, we must draw it carefully,
not in wild resentment, but in grim and sober consideration;
and when back of the impregnable fortress of the Divine
Right of Self Defense, which is sanctioned by every law of
God and man, in every land, civilized or uncivilized, we must
take our unfaltering stand. Honor, endless and undying
Honor, to every man, black or white, who in Houston, East
St. Louis, Washington and Chicago gave his life for Civilization
and Order. If the United States is to be a Land of
Law, we would live humbly and peaceably in it—working,
singing, learning and dreaming to make it and ourselves
nobler and better; if it is to be a Land of Mobs and Lynchers,
we might as well die today as tomorrow.</p>

<p>In a consideration of these two utterances, if it
be conceded that in point of literary excellence, DuBois’s
appeal is superior, yet that does not establish
that in his call he better plays the part of leader
than the Negro minister, first quoted, whose exhortation
to his race, unlike that of DuBois, is in no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
way overstrained, nor pitched too high for the
humblest, if possessed of rudimentary intelligence,
to grasp. The detailed instructions in Wright’s
publication, simple as they are, contain wisdom, the
wisdom which crieth out in the streets from of
old; while if the comparison instituted, by DuBois
between the Northern and the Southern whites, in
respect to the police and public opinion in the two
sections, is true, it is passing strange, that unlike
the Negro minister, he is not found advising the
migration from the worse to the better section, as
far as the needs of his race are concerned. If in
the North, even if justice moves limpingly as he
describes; yet according to him justice does move.
And for the poor and oppressed what gain can out-weigh
justice? But there is a graver comparison to
be instituted between these calls. DuBois in his
publication exclaims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Honor, endless and undying Honor, to every man, black
or white who in Houston, East St. Louis, Washington and
Chicago gave his life for Civilization and Order.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now whatever wrongs or supposed wrongs the
Negro soldiery suffered in Houston, can it be reasonably
contended that they, armed by the Federal
Government and enlisting to be under its orders,
in breaking away from the control of their superior
officers and with weapons put in their hands for
other purposes, in any way assisted civilization and
order by precipitating themselves upon the white
population in an attempt to shoot up the city? If
he does so claim then he is worse than the Negro
soldiery who so acted, or those Negroes and whites,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
no matter who they were, who criticised Roosevelt’s
action in the Brownsville matter. No matter to what
lofty station Roosevelt’s critics may have been advanced;
no matter what service they may claim
to have rendered peace and civilization, their weakness
in that first instance induced the graver breach,
for which, under President Wilson, as commander-in-chief,
the Negro soldiery were courtmartialed
and punished for their excesses at Houston. Yet
while the perusal of DuBois’s call, as above, does
not convey a positive stand for or against the Negro
soldiery and is open to the criticism which appears
in Pickens’s book:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Till this day the Negro is seldom frank to the white man.
He says what he does not mean; he means what he does not
say,”—</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">apparently his view changed. As editor of The
Crisis, Dr. DuBois upon the occasion of the Chicago
riots as above noted honored every man, black or
white, who, in either Houston or Chicago, gave his
life for civilization and order; later he expressed
the following, which is nothing more nor less than a
justification of the behavior of the Negro soldiery
at Houston:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Six years ago December 11, at 7:17 in the morning,
thirteen American Negro soldiers were murdered on the
scaffold by the American government to satisfy the blood-lust
of Texas, on account of the Houston riot.”<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Now, how does this exhibit this extremely gifted
man, as a leader of his race? In the roar and
blaze of the Chicago riot, in 1919 he was for “Honor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
endless and undying Honor to every man black or
white in Houston ... who gave his life for civilization
and order”; but by the end of 1920, the executed
Negro soldiers had become martyrs, murdered
by the government.</p>

<p>But in justice to this most excitable man, it must
be admitted that there can be found whites of cultivation
and intellect just as wild. Take the case of
Dr. H. J. Seligman.</p>

<p>With all the insufferable conceit of a certain class
of white, he appropriates the work of Negroes,
(easily recognized by those who have heard their
most intelligent speakers), denatures it of the humor
which makes its appeal and presents it to the
public, as his own indictment of the South. “The
Southern dogma colors the rest of the country,” he
says. Yet he admits—“In so far as the South is
concerned, conditions improve as the Negro moves
out.” Another writer, Stephen Graham, starts his
book with crediting to the Negro slaves emancipated
in 1863 the “twelve millions out of a total of a
hundred millions of all races blending in America.”<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
As the census postdating his book gives only 10,389,328
Negroes for 1920, and as in all reason
nearly two millions of these may be argued to be
the progeny of the free persons of color of 1860,
the contribution to the race from the class of colored
person invariably ignored by English and Northern
writers must approach almost a third. But that is
not sensational. So journeying through Virginia,
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
and Mississippi, visiting Negroes, accepting their
hospitality and practicing social equality, Graham
most inconsiderately denounces their smell and, because
he failed to reach and establish any spiritual
touch, in his attempt to address them, stupidly decides
there was none to be attained. Expressing
the belief that the Negroes of New York and Chicago
were firmer in flesh and will than those in the
South and yield more hope for the race in the
light of the extra prosperity and happiness of the
Northern Negroes, he nevertheless crawls back to
the feet of Northern prejudice with the declaration
against the migration of the Negroes from the South
to the North and the consequent even distribution
over the whole of the country, because it would
take “hundreds of years to even them out” and
“they would probably crowd more and more into the
large cities and be as much involved in evil conditions,
as they were in the South.” Can it be possible
that there are nothing but evil conditions in
the great cities of the North and West? Is it not
the belief of the Northern authorities, that what
the Negro needs is education? What education is
equal to residence in these great pulses of our civilization?
Has not Mr. Graham, himself attested
“the extra prosperity and happiness of the Northern
Negroes?” Why then attempt to throw doubts
on the benefits to the Negro from diffusion? It
might as well be faced without any more squirming.
It is inevitable. By the law of compensation, that
section of our great country, which for a hundred
years or more has represented to the admiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
world all the virtue, intelligence and civilization of
the United States, especially in its treatment of the
colored race will have to endeavor to live up to its
reputation. The aspiring Negro is not going to be
denied that contact with the most advanced civilization
of this country, which those who freed him
owe to him. If he crowds into the great cities, it is
because there he finds its most advertised display,
and so the most active and energetic push into it
with some contempt for their feeble self elected leaders,
who have preached against or kept quiet concerning
it.</p>

<p>For three decades prior to the war between the
States, the Southern States of the Union had made
railroad development secondary to the Negro question.
Constituting as they did in area at that time
fully one-half of the States; peopled with 3,575,634
whites and 2,176,127 Negroes, they had been led to
base their civilization on the substratum of an inferior
race, putting that wild conception even above
the Federal Union, that great experiment in government,
which they had been most instrumental in
framing. After their overthrow, Reconstruction
raised the spectre of the Negro outstripping the
whites in the South and almost assuredly in the
lower South. And what establishes the wonderful
clearness of the vision of the Negro, William Hannibal
Thomas, was his ability, two years before the
overthrow of Reconstruction, to see through the
mists of 1874, which so completely shrouded the
vision of Judge Albion Tourgee as late as 1888 in
his “Appeal to Caesar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>For Thomas realized, from the outset, that the
Negro majority of South Carolina could not last.</p>

<p>In the hundred years which have elapsed since
1820, the proportion of the Negro population to the
whites in the United States, as a whole, has dropped
from 19 per cent to 9.9 per cent, the whites rising
from 81 per cent to 90.1 per cent. With regard to
the Negro population in the Southern States as compared
with the rest of the United States, the proportion
in the South has dropped from 92.5 per cent to
84.2 per cent, the percentage of the rest of the
United States rising from 8 per cent to 15.98 per
cent. But while it is treated as a movement of
one hundred years, as far as the South is concerned,
on account of the unknown accretions prior to 1860
through the illicit slave trade and the magnetic attraction
of Reconstruction, it could be more accurately
represented as a movement of forty years.</p>

<p>In the five great States of Kentucky, Tennessee,
Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, embracing an
area of about 224,960 square miles of contiguous
territory, the white population had risen from 4,112,564
in 1880, to 7,444,218 in 1920; while in the
same period the Negro population had increased
from 2,408,654 only to 3,223,791. But what is even
more striking is the fact that in the last decade there
has been an actual decrease of 143,288 in the Negro
population of this Southern area.</p>

<p>At the same time in the five great States of Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin the Negro
population has risen to 514,589, and to the East
of the great Northwest, in the Middle States and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
New England 709,453 were found to be; while West
of the Mississippi river, outside of the old South, into
a region, which before the war between the States
was prairie and almost unexplored mountain and
desert, 314,879 Negroes have moved. Yet in the
South they still constitute 26 per cent of the population
to only 3 per cent outside, in the rest of the
Union.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham’s impression, however, that it will
“take hundreds of years to even them out” is a
hasty and illconsidered judgment. Louisiana, which
forty years ago had a colored majority of 28,707,
had by the Census of 1920 a white majority of 396,360.
Georgia had increased its white majority
from 90,773 in 1880 to 482,749 in 1920; while the
great cotton planting State of Alabama had raised
its majority in the same period from 62,083 to 546,972.
Considering what the Census figures show
for Virginia, suffering as no State suffered from the
war between the States, engaged in by her for no
purpose of sustaining a black substratum for her
civilization; but for a purpose identical with that
which the civilized world acclaimed for Belgium
and supporting the shock of war with a courage and
devotion not surpassed by France in the Great War,
she was shorn of about a third of her area and four-tenths
of her white population, in utter defiance of
the Constitution; but, now with a white majority
which has risen from 57.5 per cent to 70.1 per cent,
she is in a healthier condition than the portion which
was carved out of her flank. The gain of North
Carolina is even greater. Taking the whole South,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
we find, that from 1880 to 1920 the white population
has increased from 12,309,087 to 25,016,579;
while during the same period the colored has only
risen from 6,013,215 to 8,801,753. It is true that
by the Census of 1920 two Southern States, Mississippi
and South Carolina still each had a colored
majority; but one which had shrunk from 213,227
to only 46,181 in South Carolina and from 170,893
in Mississippi to 81,262; the percentage of whites
in South Carolina being 48.6 per cent and in Mississippi
48.3 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>Until the Census of 1930 is published we shall
not know positively; but in this, the fifth year
since the last census, all available information seems
to indicate that in both States the white minority
has been converted into a white majority. By the
census of the United States for 1920 in the 875,670
square miles which constitute the Southern States
there were 25,016,579 whites and 8,801,753 colored
inhabitants; while the remaining 2,150,600 square
miles of the Union held 70,925,032 whites and 1,552,402
Negroes, with 109,966 under strictly Federal
control at Washington. But again, North of
the Northern line of the United States extends a
region greater in area than the United States in
which as indicated by the Canadian census of 1921
there are only 8,750,643 inhabitants. The door of
opportunity therefore still remains open to the Negro
in America and his inability to see this, throughout
the fifty eight years of his freedom in which it
has been accessible to him by foot, while handicapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
by their ignorance of our wants, our customs and
our language, the impoverished whites of Europe
have crossed the three thousand miles of water which
barred them, offers the most striking proof of the
Negro’s lack of capacity to help himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in justice to the Negroes as a whole, it
should be noted that in no race that has ever existed
has it been easier to use the supposed leaders
against the true interests of the masses, than is
apparent in the history of the Negroes. Yet even
these, as they now clash with each other, emit some
sparks of political intelligence. Meanwhile the masses
are growing more accustomed to judge for themselves.
Northern environment has not been without
its effect upon them. They are taking something
from it and they are going to give something to it.</p>

<p>In the Northwest, in all probability, they are in
the next decade apt to gather in such numbers, as
to affect both the South and Canada, although in
exactly opposite ways. To a considerable extent
what The New Republic foresaw in 1916 is coming
to pass; but in somewhat quicker movement than
that paper anticipated. The last great effort to
induce them to remain in the South their “natural
home” has been made. It has utterly failed. They
are steadily moving out and diffusion is proceeding
without any of the ills so continuously alleged as inseparable
with such a movement.</p>

<p>And now to this last effort, the comments upon it
and what may be called the first Negro Crusade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
we should pay some attention, and then close with
an allusion to the most helpful discussion ever instituted
concerning the Negro.</p>

</div>

<p>At Birmingham, Alabama, President Harding
spoke on the Negro question, October 25, 1921.
Elected president by the greatest majority which
had ever placed a president in power, his remarks,
if not very profoundly wise, were unquestionably
bravely frank. His position was that unless there
should “be recognition of the absolute divergence in
things social and racial,” there might be “occasion
for great and permanent differentiation.” To quote
him in such passages as most clearly and unequivocally
expressed his views, he will be found to have
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Men of different races may well stand uncompromisingly
against any suggestion of social equality. Indeed it would
be helpful to have the word equality eliminated from this
consideration, to have it accepted on both sides that this is
not a question of social equality but a question of recognizing
a fundamental, eternal and inescapable difference. We
shall have made real progress when we develop an attitude
in the public and community thought of both races which
recognizes the difference.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To this he added, as if replying to some unexpressed
utterance, altho’ he was the sole speaker:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I would accept that a black man cannot be a white man
and that he does not need and should not aspire to be as
much like a white man as possible in order to accomplish
the best that is possible for him.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In these two utterances President Harding put
himself in accord with Abraham Lincoln and in opposition
to Theodore Roosevelt’s dinner to Booker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
Washington, and, from this, he drew near to what
is supposed to be the teaching of Booker Washington:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I would say let the black man vote when he is fit to vote....
I have no sympathy with the half baked altruism that
would overstock us with doctors and lawyers of whatever
color and leave us in need of people fit and willing to do the
manual work of a work-a-day world.”<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>
</div>

<p>From these generalizations, after quoting from
F. D. Lugard a paragraph which even a Philadelphia
lawyer would be puzzled to unravel, in which it is
declared that while there shall be equality in the
paths of knowledge and culture and equal admiration
and opportunity, yet each must pursue his own
inherited traditions, and while agreeing to be spiritually
equal diverge physically and materially, the
President reached the piece-de-resistance of his discourse:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is probable that as a nation we have come to the end
of the period of very rapid increase in our population. Restricted
immigration will reduce the rate of increase and
force us back upon our older population to find people to do
the simpler physically harder manual tasks. This will require
some difficult adjustments. In anticipation of such a
condition the South may well recognize that the North and
West are likely to continue their drains upon its colored
population, and that if the South wishes to keep its fields
producing and its industry still expanding it will have to
compete for the services of the colored man.”<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To this, the most important part of the President’s
remarks, while complimenting the tone and spirit
of the whole, the same paper in which Carlyle McKinley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
in 1889 sought to reveal to the South its
true policy, thus replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The South would be glad to see a considerable part of
the negro population in this section find homes in other sections.”<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The comment of that Northern publication which
had, as has been shown, most intelligently discussed
the migration of the Negroes from the South to the
North and West in 1916, was to the effect that while
the President’s scheme had much to recommend it
as far as the spirit was concerned, yet—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The South knows as President Harding ought to know
that you can’t draw a sharp line between politics and social
life. The offices of a State are in most parts of America
positions of social leadership. With complete political
equality the State of Mississippi might easily elect a Negro
as governor. Would such a result be accepted by Mississippi
as devoid of social significance? The race problem unfortunately
is not one that admits of easy general solutions.”<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The President’s speech appeared about the time
at which Dr. DuBois returned from the second of the
Pan-African congresses in Europe, which he had
been mainly instrumental in convening and at which
there were Negroes and mulattoes from West and
South Africa, British Guiana, Grenada, Jamaica,
Nigeria and the Gold Coast; Indians from India and
East Africa; colored men from London; and twenty-five
American Negroes. There were meetings at
London, Brussels and Paris.</p>

<p>The London congress over which presided a distinguished
English administrator, later Secretary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
of State for India, Sir Sidney Olivier, was mild, the
chairman making no attempt to control the findings.
But at Brussels, where—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“the black Senegalese, Blaise Diagne, French Deputy and
High Commissioner of African troops—”<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">presided—</p>

<p>DuBois says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We sensed the fear about us in a war land with nerves
still taut.”<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It seems Oswald Garrison Villard, with that refreshing
conceit which tempts him to discuss any
subject whether he knows anything about it or not,
had been ignorantly denouncing conscription, imposed
on French Negroes.</p>

<p>With infinitely superior political acumen the London
congress under the leadership of DuBois, or
certainly with his approval, claimed the right to
bear it equally with white Frenchmen, as long as
France recognized racial equality; but when DuBois
at Brussels, after a few days of harmless
palaver—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“rose the last afternoon and read in French and English the
resolutions of London—”<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">there was some stir. This is the scene, as depicted
by DuBois:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Diagne, the Senegales Frenchman who presided was beside
himself with excitement after the resolutions were read;
as under secretary of the French government; as ranking
Negro of greater France, and perhaps as a successful investor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
in French Colonial enterprises he was undoubtedly
in a difficult position. Possibly he was bound by actual
promises to France and Belgium. His French was almost
too swift for my ears, but his meaning was clear; he felt
that the cause of the black man had been compromised by
black American radicals; he especially denounced our demand
for ‘the restoration of the ancient common ownership of the
land in Africa’ as rank communism.”<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Dr. DuBois does not explain wherein it was not;
but contents himself with declaring that Diagne used
his power as chairman and prevented a vote, the
question being referred to the French congress.
Later in conversation with DuBois, Diagne declared
that he had “only sought to prevent the assassination
of a race.”</p>

<p>In his final analysis of the congress at Paris, DuBois
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“France recognizes Negro equality, not only in theory but
in practice, she has for the most part enfranchised her
civilized Negro citizens. But what she recognizes is the
equal right of her citizens black and white to exploit by
modern industrial methods her laboring classes black and
white; and the crying danger to black France is that its
educated and voting leaders will join in the industrial robbery
of Africa, rather than lead its masses to education and
culture.”<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>
</div>

<p>DuBois thought Diagne and Candace, while unwavering
defenders of racial opportunity, education
for and the franchise for the civilized, “curiously
timid” when the industrial problems of Africa
“were” approached. Well so was the Negro, Martin
R. Delany, candidate for lieutenant governor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
South Carolina in 1874. He had had advantages for
studying the African problems which Dr. DuBois
had possibly not enjoyed to the same degree. Delany
in his younger days had been an African explorer
and, even if he had not penetrated very deeply
into “The Dark Continent,” had seen the African
Negro in his lair. He and his younger co-laborer
for reform in South Carolina, William Hannibal
Thomas, ex-Union soldier from Ohio, as has been
narrated, supported the candidacy of Judge Green
for governor of South Carolina, in 1874, against the
brilliant white Carpet-Bagger Daniel H. Chamberlain
and his lieutenant, the even less reputable black
Carpet-Bagger, R. B. Elliott. But while Thomas accepted
Chamberlain, in 1876, as a changed man, with
regard to Chamberlain’s accompaniment, Delany,
who had been in South Carolina since 1865, eleven
years to Thomas’s three, was still “curiously timid.”</p>

<p>DuBois later enlarged his experience by a trip to
Africa and, before that, possibly may have been
moved by the work of a French Negro scholar who
had made some mark in the literary world and occasioned
some stir in French colonial politics, just
after the Pan-African congress. But upon his
return from these in 1921 DuBois at once addressed
himself to the consideration of President Harding’s
Birmingham speech.</p>

<p>With a curious sympathy for the man, Harding,
and a display of rank ingratitude to that white
leader who had dared to do more for the Negro,
than Harding thought became a white man, DuBois
declared:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The President made a braver, clearer utterance than
Theodore Roosevelt ever dared to make or than William H.
Taft or William McKinley ever dreamed of....</p>

<p>Mr. Harding meant that the American Negro must acknowledge
that it was wrong and a disgrace for Booker T.
Washington to dine with President Roosevelt.”<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Although thus praising the President and with a
wholly gratuitous sneer at the dead Roosevelt who
had dared the “disgrace” and suffered for it, the
Doctor asserted Harding’s “braver clearer utterance”
was “an inconceivably dangerous and undemocratic
demand,” which he disposes of with one
sweep of his pen, which not only wiped out Harding’s
speech; but also brushed away the basis upon
which John Stuart Mill erected his political economy,
to wit—“the first impulse of mankind is to follow
and obey, servitude rather than freedom is their
natural state.”</p>

<p>Not so in the view of Dr. DuBois:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No system of social uplift which begins by denying the
manhood of a man can end by giving him a free ballot,
a real education and a just wage.”<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In reply to this it may be said, that when the Negroes
are thoroughly diffused throughout the United
States, they are apt to get as free a ballot as the
whites and proportionately the same education; but
when all who labor, white or black, get a just wage,
the millennium will have arrived and the capitalistic
lion will be lying down with the horny headed laboring
lamb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

<p>It cannot be denied, however, that Dr. DuBois
stirred up some comment with his congresses and
those who believe in the exhortation—“let there be
light” will be interested in the French and German
utterances thereon.</p>

<p>The Paris Temps, generally considered the organ
of the French government, editorializes in these
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is the claims of the wiser group which must be studied....
The road will be long for Negroes in the League
of Nations toward the liberation modest though it is, whose
program they have elaborated in their Congress. But there
is nothing to keep us French from putting into immediate
practice some articles at least of this program to start
with.”<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is a world wide echo of Hayne’s Speech on
the floor of the United States Senate just about a
century earlier. It is also to some extent an endorsement
of Diagne, whom DuBois had criticised
as “curiously timid.” The portrait of the remarkable
Senegalese who played such an Ajax to DuBois’s
ambitious Hector does not appear; but an
entire front page of The Crisis is given to Maran,
the Black Thersites of the race.</p>

<p>If DuBois would accept Diagne as the leader of
the Negro people some results might come; but
the Negro in DuBois will scarcely permit this. He
might accept the far less able white, Oswald Garrison
Villard. But no Negro.</p>

<p>The German comment on the congress is less
cautious than the French but points in the same
direction:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Congress was called by Dr. Burghardt DuBois, an
American mulatto who has been prominent in his native
country for many years as a race agitator. Its purpose
was to draw together all Negro organizations throughout the
world. The agenda included: the segregation of the colored
races; the race problem in England, America and South
Africa; and a future programme....</p>

<p>The attendance at London and Brussels was very small,
but some four hundred delegates from every portion of the
world participated in the proceedings at Paris.... At the
London session the radical ideas of DuBois, which approached
those of Garvey were in the ascendant and force was preached
as a possible alternative to attain the ends which the Negroes
have in view.... At Brussels, Deputy Diagne, a
member of the French Parliament from Senegal, presided.
When he saw that radical ideas were likely to prevail there
also, he arbitrarily terminated the session. At Paris the
programme was cut and dried.... The newspapers gave
full and sympathetic reports of the sessions. France by
this stroke of diplomacy attained her purpose. Under the
skilful leadership of the French deputy Diagne, the Congress
adopted a more moderate programme of evolution instead
of revolution, culminating in a platform demanding
equality of all civilized men without distinction of race; a
systematic plan for educating the colored races; liberty
for the natives to retain their own religion and manners;
restoration of native titles to their former lands and to its
produce; the establishment of an international institute to
study and record the development of the black race; the
protection of the black race by the League of Nations; and
the creation of a separate section in the International Labor
Bureau to deal with Negro labor.”<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In this report it is claimed both the United States
and England are handled harshly, while France is
praised. It seems Sir Harry Johnston is, to some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
degree, in accord with this praise of France, at the
expense of his own country, his opinion being:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All in all, I am of the opinion that the French nation
since 1871 has dealt with the Negro problem in Africa and
in tropical America more wisely, prudently and successfully
than we English have done.”<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is this very fluent gifted linguist, in all probability,
who is responsible for the picturesque conclusion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Finally it is perfectly certain that the race question is
the rock upon which the British Empire will be wrecked or
the corner stone upon which the greatest political structure
in the history of the world will be erected.”<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But if from a representative of Imperial Germany,
the only country which ever enacted as a part of its
organic law the principle of Nullification, it surpasses
in grandiosity and positiveness of statement
the dictum of Calhoun in 1837:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have for the last 12 years been going through a great
and dangerous juncture. The passage is almost made and,
if no new cause of difficulty should intervene, it will be successfully
made. I, at present, see none but the abolition
question, which however, I fear is destined to shake the
country to its centre.... For the first time the bold ground
has been taken that slaves have a right to petition Congress
... itself emancipation.... Our fate as a people
is bound up in the question. If we yield, we will be extirpated;
but if we successfully resist, we will be the greatest
and most flourishing people of modern time. It is the
best substratum of population in the world and one on which
great and flourishing Commonwealths may be most easily
and safely reared.”<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>

<p>We of the South know, we did not successfully
resist emancipation; were not extirpated; but do
form part of “the greatest and most flourishing
people of modern time.” We must realize that, no
matter what was the price paid for it, emancipation
was salvation for the South. It was a deliverance
from the “body of death,” Reviewing our history,
we find that in the same year that Calhoun, the
greatest disruptive force in our politics, pronounced
the dictum last quoted, a comparatively young and
unknown politician, destined to be the greatest cementing
force of the Union, declared—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice
and bad policy; but that the promulgation of abolition
doctrines tends rather to promote than to abate its evils.”<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In discussing this utterance of Lincoln, his latest
biographer, Mr. Stephenson, who declares it reveals
the dawn of his intellect, beautifully pictures
how—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“arise the two ideas, the faith in a mighty governing power;
the equal faith that it should use its might with infinite
tenderness; that it should be slow to compel results.”<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Going back ten years before the dawn of Lincoln’s
intellect, and four prior to the declaration that the
Negro question was, as he, Calhoun, saw it an
African slave substratum on which great and flourishing
commonwealths could be most easily and
safely reared, Hayne, on the floor of the United
States Senate, voiced in his own words, Lincoln’s
subsequently sponsored thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>

<p>Harken to Hayne:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Thus, Sir, it appears that the Almighty in the wise order
of his providence has marked out the course of events, which
will not only remove all danger, but gradually and effectually
and in his own good time accomplish our deliverance
from what gentleman are pleased to consider as the curse
of the land.”<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In 1827, it is apparent that the Negro question
was a different question than it later became to the
South; and that the strengthening and possible
spread of slavery was in some measure due to Calhoun’s
devotion to it, over and above all other questions,
even before Nullification, is evidenced by his
letter to Maxcy in 1830:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I consider the Tariff, but as the occasion rather than the
real cause of the present unhappy state of things.”<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Strange to state, even at that early date, he
writes of the South possibly being compelled to
“rebel,” to preserve her “peculiar institution.”</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Lower South, Lincoln and not
Seward was elected president in 1860; for had
Seward been raised to that position of preeminence,
in all human probability the seven States of South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana, and Texas would have been allowed to secede
and attempt the experiment of government involved
therein, with a population of 2,619,116 whites,
36,861 free persons of color, many of whom were
slave owners, and 2,312,372 Negro slaves.</p>

<p>That the colored population would have increased
rapidly is a reasonable conclusion. Virginia, North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee, in all probability,
would have speedily divested themselves of a
great proportion of the 1,324,166 slaves they held
and, even if such Southern statesmen as Leonidas
Washington Spratt had not been able to reopen the
African slave trade, the smuggling in of slaves on
a greater and greater increasing scale would have
been a consequence. Slavery being the corner stone
of the new political structure, it would have been
natural that the view of Governor Seabrook, that
slave holding Negroes should be admitted to the
ballot, would have eventually prevailed. War might
have come between the large and small sections
of North America from some frontier incident
concerning Arkansas, the Indian Territory or
Mexico; but it could scarcely have been the pulverizing
conflict which the Lower South sustained by the
two and a half million additional whites of Virginia,
North Carolina and Tennessee, maintained
for four years of desperate struggle.</p>

<p>Each year that the conflict was delayed would
have found the States which remained in the old
Union stronger and whiter, sickling the seceded
States with railroads and quite possibly drawing
Canada into their orbit; for as Sir Charles Dilke has
pointed out in his Problems of Greater Britain,
published when the annexation of Canada was still
a debatable question—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“a fact often overlooked in England is that hitherto the
western centres of population of British North America
have been more intimately connected with districts lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
South of them across the American frontier than with
places East and West of them, within the Canadian border.”<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The days of the “Little Englanders” were only
then passing, when the colonies had almost been
considered a nuisance.</p>

<p>But whether the region mapped out now as Winnipeg,
Alberta and the other wheat areas of the
Canadian West might have been attached to the
great white Union in the sixties, if undisturbed by
war and moving with continuingly accelerated industrial
development or not, the Union would have
become whiter, as the Lower South darkened; and
Calhoun’s “substratum” theory would have there
been tested to the fullest extent and risk.</p>

<p>From this Lincoln’s adroit political play induced
the Lower South, by firing on the flag, to save itself,
unknowingly. By the invasion of Virginia he forced
that State, as well as North Carolina and Tennessee,
into the Confederacy, against which, in 1862,
he drew the weapon of emancipation without the
least idea as to how deep it must cut. For it has
proven to be a two edged sword.</p>

<p>Nothing more clearly reveals Lincoln’s ignorance
of the inevitable consequences of emancipation, than
his message to Congress in December, 1862:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth
and cover the whole land. Are they not already in the land?
Will liberation make them more numerous? Equally distributed
among the whites of the whole country and there
would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
in any way disturb the seven?... But why should emancipation
South send the free people North? People of any
color seldom run unless there be something to run from.
Heretofore to some extent they have fled North from bondage
and destitution. But if gradual emancipation and deportation
be adopted they will have neither to flee from....
And in any event cannot the North decide for itself whether
to receive them?”<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If this was the Great Emancipator’s view of
emancipation, what wonder that the “Southern color
psychosis” should spread like measles, from contact
alone.</p>

<p>The Congressional Reconstructionists thought
that they had won in the war between the States
what has since been styled euphoniously, “a sphere
of influence,” a subject people to sell goods to. But
the mass of Northern and Western whites, true
Americans, sickened of the excesses of Congressional
Reconstruction. The Federal troops were
withdrawn on the order of a true patriot, Rutherford
B. Hayes, President of the United States, and
not of a section.</p>

<p>Chastened and disciplined by their fall from
power, the most energetic and industrious, the boldest
and most assertive Negroes have, since 1876,
been steadily moving into the mammoth cities of
the North and West, to there build up in the segregated
districts, groups of New Negroes, as the Report
of the Chicago riot shows “more perfect thro
suffering.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>By a joint committee of blacks and whites that
riot has been discussed and that makes the discussion
the more valuable.</p>

<p>In that great city of two and a half million of inhabitants,
after ten days of riot, bloodshed, arson
and murder, in response to the appeal of representative
citizens, Governor Lowden appointed an
emergency committee to study the underlying causes
of the riot of 1919 and to make recommendations.
According to the Census of 1920 there were then in
Chicago 109,458 Negroes. The chairman of the
committee was Edgar A. Bancroft, a leading lawyer,
subsequently appointed by President Coolidge
Ambassador to Japan. The vice chairman was
Dr. Francis W. Sheppardson, at one time of the
University of Chicago. The most prominent Negro
on the Committee was Robert S. Abbott, proprietor
of the greatest and most influential Negro
paper in the United States, <cite>The Chicago Defender</cite>.
The report was published in 1922. It indicates 38
persons killed in the riot, 15 whites and 23 Negroes.
Of the 527 injured, 178 were white, 342 Negroes,
the race denomination of 17 not being established.</p>

<p>For the 38 deaths, there were nine presentments
for murder returned, four persons being convicted.</p>

<p>While it is stated that the merciless bombing of
Negro households was due to a systematic campaign
conducted by the press against Negroes buying properties
to one side of the district in which 90 per cent
of the Negro population reside, that they moved,
(on account of their increase), towards the side to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
which they did go, rather than in the opposite direction,
the report says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“may be explained partly by the hostility which the Irish
and Polish groups had often shown to Negroes.”<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>
</div>

<p>That Negroes were killed deliberately, as a business
measure, in response to propaganda against
them simply as Negroes, is an unavoidable conclusion.
Extracts from “The Property Owners Journal”
show that again and again there was an attempt
to appeal to a “Higher Law” than the law
of the land. It seems to have been the law of greed.
Here is an extract:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Any property owner who sells property anywhere in our
district to undesirables is an enemy to the white owner and
should be discovered and punished.... The Negro is using
the Constitution and its legal rights to abuse the moral rights
of the white.”<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Following this hypocritical appeal, 58 houses,
bought by Negroes, were bombed, the residence of
Jesse Binga, a Negro banker having been bombed
six times without breaking down his firm determination
to stand the storm. The house of a Negro
woman was bombed three times. Her home had
been attacked in the riots and the front door battered
down; but, upon calling on the police, she and her
husband were by them arrested, altho’ later acquitted.
The report charges gross and continuous
exaggeration during the riot, in which it is distinctly
stated that the Chicago Tribune led, although
it is also stated, that the paper owned by one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
committee, in one instance, could hardly have been
surpassed. That this last statement should have
been made, speaks volumes for the fairness of the
committee and the member of the committee thus
concurring with the stricture on himself. It also
states, of the paper published by Robert S. Abbott,
“The Defender”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is probably no exaggeration to say that the Defender’s
policy prompted thousands of restless Negroes to venture
North, where there were assured of its protection and
championship of their cause.”<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Governor in his FOREWORD states that the
report shows “that the presence of Negroes in large
numbers in our great cities is not a menace in itself.”
Incidents cited showed high courage and
efficiency on the part of Negro policeman and the
exhibition of a stern sense of duty controlling race
prejudice.</p>

<p>The report says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is clear that migrant Negroes are not returning South.
On the contrary there is a small but continuous stream of
migration to the industrial centres of the North. No great
numbers of Negroes returned to the South even during the
trying unemployment period in the early part of 1921.”<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Sustaining the country’s stand against the unrestricted
immigration of the ante bellum period,
just about this time, the New Republic asserted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If we can hold the gates closed for another decade, these
abuses are bound to go. Not everybody in America would
like this. Nor would everybody in America be pleased with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
another natural consequence of restriction, that it will draw
more and more Negroes out of the rural South, especially
the lynching belt for common labor in the industries.”<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In his FOREWORD to the Chicago report, Governor
Lowden places himself in absolute opposition
to Lincoln. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our race problem must be solved in harmony with the
fundamental law of the nation and with its free institutions.
These prevent any deportation of the Negro as well as any
restriction of his freedom of movement within the United
States.”<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But the report of the Chicago riot contains much
more than an expression of the views of the committee
as to the cause of that outburst of savagery.
In its 667 pages are the views of many Negroes on
the greatest variety of subjects. The first article
of the belief of the members of the Negro Urban
League of Chicago is—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I realize that our soldiers have learned new habits of self-respect
and cleanliness.”<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>
</div>

<p>That is a short sentence, but it contains much.</p>

<p>Here is another which indicates that the Negro
will not only learn much from the Northern and
Western white man; but also teach him a bit. It
is not very sweetly expressed, but it is well worth
pondering for all that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is one trait, and I might say only one, that I
take off my hat to the southern ‘Cracker’ for, and that is
his respect and high regard for women. While he hasn’t
much for the other fellow’s (the Negro’s) wives and daughters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
yet he respects his own. We must set a good example
for him and respect all women, regardless of race, color or
creed. Then you will win the admiration of all civilized
people. Men who do not respect and honor their women are
not worthy of citizenship.”<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Only one trait, but what an important one!</p>

</div>

<p>Passing from the report of the Negro riot in
Chicago, of 1919 to the Negro Year Book for the
same date, we find therein the assertion, that the
aggregate wealth of the 10,300,000 Negroes in the
United States, at that date, was estimated at $1,100,000,000.</p>

<p>Whatever the wealth or progress of the Negroes
in the United States is asserted to be, at any time,
it is customary to allude to it, as that much in excess
of nothing at the time of Emancipation. The
Negro writers in particular are prone to claim this.
This has been, in some degree, shown in this study
to be incorrect; but it may be well to go a little
further into the matter.</p>

<p>In the year 1860 the 4,441,800 colored persons in
the United States consisted of 488,070 free persons
of color and 3,953,730 Negro and mulatto slaves.
The 488,070 free persons of color were about evenly
divided between the Northern and the Southern
States. They possessed property. What was the
probable value of their holdings?</p>

<p>The Census of 1860 shows, that in the city of
Charleston, South Carolina, there were 3,237 free
persons of color and that 357 of them returned property
for taxation, on which they paid $12,015.60 in
taxes, mainly upon real estate, probably about seven-eighths
of the whole. But they also paid taxes on
income and business, as well as head taxes on the
slaves they owned and upon their horses, carriages
and dogs. With the generally accepted average
value for slaves and a safe valuation for horse-flesh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
as the value of the real estate is disclosed, we can calculate
that the aggregate wealth of the free persons
of color in Charleston, S. C., in 1860 must have been
about $888,650. Unless there was some particular
advantage, materially, in a residence, by free persons
of color, in that State and city most identified
with “the peculiar institution,” the per capita established
can be extended to the whole population
of this class in the United States, at that date;
which would have accordingly amounted to about
$133,989,231.</p>

<p>Of course there may have been greater wealth
among the free persons of color in Charleston than
in the rest of the State of South Carolina; but for
the same reason there would have been still greater
wealth in New Orleans and the greater cities of the
North, where real estate was necessarily of greater
value with a greater growth.</p>

<p>As the free persons of color had more than quadrupled
in the six decades ending in 1860, what
reason is there to think that, inured to the responsibilities
of freedom, their rate of increase, after
the emancipation of the mass of slaves, should have
materially lessened?</p>

<p>With the Negro slaves emancipated in mass it
would be different; and therefore it is not at all
unlikely, that of the $1,100,000,000 owned in 1919
by the entire Negro population of the United States,
something like $535,957,124 should be credited to
the descendants of the free persons of color, best
equipped at the outset to reap their share of the
wealth the War between the States brought to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
North and West, rather than to the greater number
of the emancipated remaining in the impoverished
South and suffering with the whites the evils of
Congressional Reconstruction. That it took the
South until 1890 to regain in material wealth what
they had lost between 1861 and 1876, while in the
same period the advance in material gain in the
North and West was the envy of the world, but
clinches the argument.</p>

<p>Selfishness is, however, not infrequently the accompaniment
of increasing prosperity and, therefore,
it should not surprise any thoughtful individual
to note, that the cultured DuBois and not a few of
his white acclaimers look somewhat askance at the
steady movement of the Southern Negroes out of the
South and into the North and West.</p>

<p>This is not the attitude, however, of that Negro
whose name heads the report of the committee on
the Chicago riot.</p>

<p>Robert S. Abbott comes nearer the Biblical description
of the owner of the vineyard. He wishes
to share with the laborers of his race the fields he
has garnered so successfully with his weekly paper,
the “Chicago Defender” and therefore whatever may
be his extravagances of expression, he seems to be
the most unselfish leader the Negroes have.</p>

<p>In thus turning to the weekly rather than attempting
the more ambitious daily, the Negroes show
a clear-sightedness to their credit.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Negro papers are published weekly because they cannot
compete with the daily papers in providing any part of the
public with news from day to day.”<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>This is a very simple statement, but it contains
a great amount of wisdom.</p>

<p>For that part of humanity which lacks wealth the
weekly paper is a great protector. The news passes
thro’ a filterer. It gives the honest editor and publisher
an opportunity to scrutinize that which the
fierce competition for the daily item of news may
hardly permit.</p>

<p>The call for copy is not infrequently a call of distress.
To fill a void may bring about a hasty selection
of cartoon plate, by no means hastily prepared;
but possibly for just such a contingency. These so
selected, not seldom undo the effect of an editorial,
while much masquerading as news, but in reality
propaganda, may be hastily slapped into the forms
around two o’clock in the morning. The Negroes,
therefore, in clinging to weeklies “are wiser in their
generation than the children of light.”</p>

<p>Happily for humanity, sentimentality destroyed
slavery of the Negroes in the United States; but the
result was an intense stimulation of economic slavery
of whites and blacks, by the simple process of letting
in from Europe masses of whites, many of
whom were below the standards of numbers of
American Negroes. That having been checked, the
Negro laborer in every line must now measure himself
against the Slav and the Latin. In physical
power he is superior to the Latin; but the Latin
makes up for it in greater pertinacity and orderliness
of method. While the statement will probably
be received with derision, the training of the slave
by the Southern slave-holder and the working of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
Negro by the Southerner is not at the driving pace
at which the North and West move, and under that
spur the Northern Negro becomes a more efficient
tool. But North or South the mass has been helped
more than hindered by that which a cultivated young
Negro addressing one of the leading educational
institutions of the United States thus described:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The savage and the child, to rise to higher things must
feel the power of a stronger hand. This is the special
blessing of the American Negro and has in forty years set
him centuries ahead of his Haytien brother, who has been
self governing for one hundred years.”<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Even if he has since recanted, this was the view
of William Pickens in 1903, when awarded the Ten
Eyck Prize at Yale University. But if the Negro
is affected by the presence of the white to the Negro’s
betterment, it is only fair and just to quote a
Southern opinion with regard to the reverse.</p>

<p>Only two years later than the award to Pickens at
Yale University, a Southern scholar published “The
Coming Crisis”; which despite the fact that it is
written in flawless English, exhibits a symmetry of
composition which is altogether admirable, and
advances views held today by a vast number, not a
few of whom have achieved some reputation in the
discussion of them less intelligently than Mr. Pinckney
in 1905, his book, nevertheless, at that date,
fell absolutely flat. What Mr. Pinckney discerned
before the World War others can now also see. His
view of the Negro problem was not in accord with
the view of the author of this study. He would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
been surprised to hear that it could have been
thought to be in accord with that of Abraham Lincoln,
to a great degree, altho’ with some differences.
But in Pinckney’s discussion the Negro is merely incidental
to the subject which is to him so inspiring
as to be visualized in a passage worth pondering:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It seems probable that the history of the United States
is calculated to furnish more complete and more striking
illustration of the working of political principles than was
ever furnished to the world before. It is an experiment on
so grand a scale and interests so gigantic are at stake that
enthusiasm itself is overwhelmed in the contemplation. It
was too much to hope for, that such an experiment should be
successful from the start. Not so lightly might the latest
and greatest blessing to mankind, the gift of rational liberty,
be wrested from reluctant nature. Not without thorns and
blood and agony might such a crown be won. Were the
reward to be more easily obtained, possibly those who won
it would have proved unworthy to enjoy it. Let those remember
this that fear for the fate of the Republic. So will
their hearts be filled afresh with courage. So from within
will well up new healing streams of hope, balm of hurt
minds, refreshing, comfortable. To fall from grace is to
learn the pathway of salvation and, like the prodigal son,
to become a partaker of joys before unknown.”<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Nowhere can be found a more delicate satire, than
the chapter in his book which is entitled “Salary
and Sentiment—Reason and Revenue.” There is
also very clear and convincing reasoning. But it is
in regard to what Mr. Pinckney has to say of the
presence of the Negroes in the South that reference
now is had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>

<p>In opposition to the view of Wade Hampton, M.
C. Butler and Carlyle McKinley, according to Mr.
Pinckney:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The States themselves must control the Negro question,
or the American system is at an end. Effort on the part
of the Federal Government to control or even to tamper
with this matter must at all times result, as it has hitherto
invariably resulted, in riot and anarchy. Thus, as far as
the South is concerned, the very highest sanctions possible
are by natural law attached to strict observance of the true
constitutional construction. To travel the constitutional path
is safety and happiness; to wander from it is instant anarchy.
... The purpose is to protect all local affairs against intrusion
from without, but among those affairs first and
foremost has always stood the Negro Question, in which
there can be no hesitation, choice or possibility of alternative.
Thus the smaller matter of the presence of the Negro
is included in the larger class of matters which comprise the
whole range of local interests.... The Negro is thus the
(wholly unconscious) means of illustrating the necessity for
constitutional self government. His presence effectually prevents
the South from departing for an instant from the
Constitutional pathway. Cuffy must be remembered if the
Republic is to be saved.”<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is in agreement with the view, that the
Southern States are Democratic, because the presence
of the Negro, now freed, forces them to be so.</p>

<p>There may be truth in that; but it may be, that
they are and have been Democratic in spite of the
Negro.</p>

<p>The publication of the List of Tax-Payers in
Charleston, “The Hot-Bed of Secession”, in 1860 was
an illustration of the thorough-going democracy of
the place and the people, at that time. It was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
open display of the strength and weakness of each
and every governmental burden bearer, and of the
burdens imposed. What could be more democratic
than that? There was a tax of 1.4 per cent on real
estate; a tax of 1.4 per cent on stocks of goods.
There was no tax on bonds and no tax on stock,
because, without interest or dividends, the scrip is
mere paper. But there was a tax on interest and
dividends of 2.5 per cent; the same on gross income;
commissions; annuities and gross receipts of all
commercial agencies. On premiums of insurance
there was a tax of 1.25 per cent. On capital in
shipping, as it should have been, the tax was light,
only .75 per cent; for shipping is the very life of a
seaport. But it was also gainful, so it was taxed for
some of its gain. The foolish idea of absolute exemption
was avoided. Luxuries were taxed fairly,
in the additional head taxes. The carriage drawn
by two horses was taxed a third more than the carriage
drawn by one. Sulkeys were taxed lower
than one horse carriages and horses and mules lower
still. Slaves were taxed, but the head tax of $3 per
slave, when it is realized that some sold for $1200
apiece was indefensibly light compared to the tax
on horse-flesh and property of that kind. One per
cent on a Negro to ten per cent on a mule by the
average value and lessening with the increase of
value of either was an immense incentive to slave-holding.
With apparently this one exception, in the
absence of that procrustean bed, the uniform rate,
upon which all property which cannot be concealed
is now stretched, the wealthy paid according to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
wealth, the poor according to their poverty; but all,
who had anything, contributed to the general welfare,
and bore a fair share of the general burden.</p>

<p>That is the real reason why they fought so long
and well. For instance on $385,000 of real estate,
28 slaves, 1 carriage and 2 horses, Otis Mills and
Otis Mills &amp; Co. paid a tax of $5,524. On $281,000
of real estate, 14 slaves, a carriage and 2 horses,
William Aiken paid a tax of $4,027.40. On $101,500
of real estate, $2,724.16, interest on bonds, 3 slaves
and $45,000 of shipping, the estate of James Adger
paid a tax of $1,835.60. On $15,000 of real estate,
$1,982 interest on bonds, $14,642 commissions, 14
slaves, 1 carriage, 3 horses and 2 dogs, Wm. C. Bee
and Wm. C. Bee &amp; Co. paid a tax of $732.60. On
a stock of goods $16,000, commissions $9,000, Jeffords
&amp; Co. paid a tax of $449. On $8,000 shipping,
$4,600 income and 3 slaves E. Lafitte &amp; Co.
paid a tax of $184. On a stock of goods of $1,000,
Samuel P. Lawrence paid a tax of $14. On 1 slave
Mrs. M. S. H. Godber paid a tax of $3. On $200
of real estate Dr. Charles M. Hitchcock paid a tax
of $1.80. On a stock of goods valued at $100, C. H.
Brunson paid a tax of $1.40. The tax imposed on
the manufacture of gas light was lighter than that
imposed on shipping; but it was gainful and on a
capital of $755,700 the Company paid a tax $3,778.50.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>That the condition of the Southern States was incalculably
improved by the abolition of slavery is
the firm belief of the author of this study. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
that from the tax legislation that followed, the
morals of all have suffered tremendously, is the belief
of many, with which he agrees.</p>

<p>The presence of the Negroes in the masses in
which they still remained in the South after emancipation
retarded even the remarkable recovery that
the South has made. In this year of 1925, the
first in a century in which the white population of
South Carolina has exceeded in numbers the colored,
it is apparent that the small industries of country
life are becoming distinctly more gainful. Why?
With lessening mass the Negro is feeling the effect
of environment. He is less of a pilferer. And with
less friction and consequent material gain, wider
opens the door to literature and art.</p>

<p>That there is an immense educational power in
art has again and again been demonstrated by artists
who have had a purpose deeper than—“Art for
art’s sake.”</p>

<p>As an illustration, one cannot fail to note that
while the educated Negroes of the North could not
possibly take at the hands of a Negro Union soldier,
who had fought for the freedom of the race and
gone thro’ the days of Congressional Reconstruction
without a stain, as a distinct Legislative leader, a
faithful description of the great mass of Negroes in
the South, they acclaimed the French Negro author
of “Batouala,” whose realistic novel of the Negro in
Africa while criticising severely their white French
rulers, damns the Negroes, even more so. The book
is not only interesting, it is instructive to those who
need the instruction; and the increasing numbers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
educated Negroes at the North needed just such a
book, in order to show them what they were rescued
from in Africa.</p>

<p>Rene Maran says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My book is not a polemic. It comes by chance when its
hour strikes. The Negro Question is of the present. Who
made it that? Why the Americans.”</p>
</div>

<p>Describing French Colonial Africa, he quotes, the
Senegalese, Diagne:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“—the best settlers have been not the professional colonials,
but the European troops from the trenches.”<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">This is in the preface.</p>

<p>The book opens with the awakening of the hero
“Batouala” in the hut in which he sleeps with his
eighth and favorite wife, Yassiguindjia. It recalls
another awakening in another realistic piece of literature,
“Old Bram” in “The Black Border.” The
only difference is between the awakening of a wolf
and the awakening of an old watch dog, “the friend
of man,” a tamed wolf. The story revolves around
the politics and desires of Batouala, Bissibingui and
Yassiguindjia. Batouala is a wolf who cares for the
pack; Bissibingui, a young wolf, as fierce, who cares
but for himself and his desires. Yassiguindjia can
only be described by one of the items with which she
was purchased.</p>

<p>In “The Black Border” it is true we are in South
Carolina, along the coast; but, as has been eloquently
stated by a Scotch South Carolinian, in that region
“there is Africa in every breath we draw.” With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
artistic power Maran pictures the sounds of the
African dawn.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Daylight broke. Although heavy with sleep still, Batouala—Batouala,
the Mokoundji, chief of so many villages—was
quite conscious of these sounds. He yawned, shivered and
stretched himself. Should he go to sleep again? Should he
get up? God! Why get up? He did not even wish to know
why....</p>

<p>“Now merely to get up—didn’t that require an enormous
effort? In itself a perfectly simple decision, so it seemed.
As a matter of fact it was hard; for getting up and working
were one and the same thing, at least to the whites....
Life is short. Work is for those who will never understand
life. Doing nothing does not degrade a man. In the eyes
of one who sees things truly, it differs from laziness. As for
him, Batouala, until it was proved to the contrary, he would
believe that to do nothing was simply to profit by everything
that surrounds us. To live from day to day without thought
of yesterday or care for the morrow, without looking ahead—that
was perfect.”<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>
</div>

<p>What a perfect picture of the Negro without “the
power of a stronger hand,” which William Pickens
saw so clearly the need of in 1903. And the philosophy
of it! Moved to visit Africa in 1924, Dr.
DuBois makes a discovery:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I began to notice it as I entered Southern France. I
formulated it in Portugal. I knew it as a great truth one
Sunday in Liberia. And the great truth was this: Efficiency
and happiness do not go together in modern culture....
And laziness; divine, eternal languor is right and good
and true.”<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Doctor praises the “manners” of the Africans.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Their manners were better than those of Park Lane or
Park Avenue, Rittenhouse Square or the North Shore....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
The primitive black man is courteous and dignified....
Wherefore shall we all take to the Big Bush? No I prefer
New York.”<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">As to the great truth, happiness depends upon what
is in the soul of the man, not upon his surroundings.</p>

<p>But Batouala while he disliked work could exert
himself to hunt or fight. His grievance was that
which has moved men more than any other thro’ all
the ages. He and his people were too heavily taxed.
He gathered the people together and harangued
them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A drunken crowd pressed up behind the group of which
Batouala was the centre. They reviled the whites. Batouala
was right, a thousand times right. Of old before the
coming of the whites, they had lived happily. They had
worked a little for themselves, they had eaten and drunk and
slept. From time to time they had had bloody palavers and
had plucked the livers from the dead to eat their courage
and incorporate it in themselves. Such had been the happy
days of old, before the coming of the whites.”<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Then follows a description of the great dance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Bissibingui was the handsomest of all. The strongest
too. His muscles stood out. His eyes glowed like the brush
on fire.... What had gone before was nothing. All the
preceding noises and outcries, the confused dancing had only
been a preparation for what was to come—the dance of
love, scarcely ever danced but on this evening, when they
were permitted to indulge in debauchery and crime....
Couples formed.... It was the immense joy of brutes loosed
from all control.... A couple dancing fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Suddenly his fingers twitching about a knife in his hand,
Batouala, the Mokoundji rushed upon this couple. He was
foaming. His fist was raised for the blow. More nimble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
than monkeys, Bissibingui and Yassiguindjia leapt out of
his reach. He pursued them. Ah, these children of a dog
had the impudence to desire each other before his very eyes.
He’d have the skin of that strumpet. As for Bissibingui ... Ah,
wouldn’t the women make fun of him then. Yassiguindjia!
The idea! Hadn’t he bought her with seven
waist cloths, a box of salt, three copper collars, a bitch, four
pots, six hens, twenty she goats, forty big baskets of millet,
and a girl slave! Ah, he’d make Yassiguindjia take the
test poison.”<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But the arrival of the commandant saves the
guilty couple. Batouala, however, still plots the life
of Bissibingui, who is plotting the robbery of his
own people, as one of the commandant’s soldiery.
In the great hunt Batouala hurls a javelin at his
rival, misses him and is himself struck down by an
infuriated passing panther. So the dark patriot
falls and the black scalawag wins. It is an impressive
picture of African life, the men, the women and
the conjugality.</p>

<p>Turn we now to the coast of South Carolina, where
in “The Black Border,” the scene is laid, for “Jim
Moultrie’s Divorce,” the deepest in discernment of
all the life like sketches of that moving book.</p>

<p>Jim, too, was a great hunter, an unwearied pursuer.
No animal. But a black man. A believer in
divorce, as almost all Negroes in America are, even
in South Carolina, where the law refuses it.</p>

<p>At the end of a cold blustering day in February,
after pushing his clumsy dug-out canoe into every
creek and lead of the Jehossee marshes, to flush
ducks for the white sportsman who had hired him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
at sun set he is turning home. How the picture appeals
to us of the coast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Far up the river, like low hung stars, twinkled the watch
fires of a great timber raft outward bound for the estuary
of the North Edisto. From a distant plantation came the
sweet lu-la-lu of a happy Negro freed from work. The
raft borne upon the bosom of the strong ebb tide, neared
rapidly, and around its fires, built on earth covered platforms,
the negro raftsmen talked and laughed as they cooked their
supper and the flames lighted the face and magnified the
figure of the black steersman who stood by the great sweep
oar, with which at the stern of the raft, he guided its course
down stream.</p>

<p>For an hour Jim had silently bucked the tide, impelling the
boat under the powerful strokes of his paddle, alternately
left and right.</p>

<p>‘What are you thinking of Jim?’</p>

<p>‘Study ’bout ’ooman, suh.’ (A short silence).</p>

<p>The obstinate silence of the woman is related and
the parting in silence. Then follows the attempt of
the woman to appease him, her jealousy gone. His
refusal. His resentment that she should have believed
an idle lie. His determination that it was
too late. And then the last two lines, which hold
so much.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jim Moultrie’s conceptions as to conjugality might
be improved upon; but they are certainly cycles
ahead of Batouala’s. It is in the sketches this book
contains and in the altogether admirable “Duel in
Cummings” that we find the Southern coast country
Negro as he is, most observant, not lacking in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
homely philosophy, and, as Thomas, the Ohio Negro,
noted (altho’ utterly lacking it himself) a creature
of infinite humor. Whence does he derive it? He
seems to lose it to some extent as he moves out of
the coast region. But he becomes more efficient.
He has benefited immensely by his sojourn in
America. He ought to take more interest in his
race elsewhere than the cultivated members seem
to. It is good for the Negroes of the United States
that numbers should continue to move into the
Northern and Western States. It is providing a
most interesting experiment. The urban Negro
dwellers of the great cities of the North and West
are furnishing a most interesting illustration of
that mysterious power which leads humanity to its
betterment. By the Census of 1920, in the great
city of New York there were 152,467 Negroes. By
the estimates of the Department of Commerce for
July, 1923, this had been increased to 183,248.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
Unless the migratory movement has slowed down
as that estimate is for July 1, 1923, the Negro population
of New York, today must be 194,445, with
that of Philadelphia at 163,248 and Chicago at 148,326.
There is no urban Negro population of these
figures anywhere in the Southern States. The
nearest would be New Orleans where the Negro population
may be 107,530. But in addition in the
great cities which stretch along and thro’ the rich
and populous territory between New York and Chicago
up to the borders of Canada the Negro population
is steadily increasing. Detroit at the very door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
of Canada holds a Negro population greater than
that of any Southern city except New Orleans; for
Baltimore is practically a Northern city now.</p>

<p>While the urban Negro population of the Southern
States appears to be increasing it is scarcely
increasing at the rate at which it is increasing in the
great section of the North above described and as
has been shown in not a few States of the South the
Negro population as a whole is decreasing slightly;
while the white population is increasing actively.
But the civilization of the Southern whites has been
handicapped by the weight of the Negro population
which it has carried for a century and more. It
should not bear any more than its fair proportion
of that load and in the natural movement of the
Negroes from the South up to the north central
portion of the Union and to some extent into Canada,
by the amalgamation of Negroes and mulattoes, a
brown people affected by the civilization of these sections,
differing in some degrees from the darker Negroes
who will more slowly develop in the Southern
States, will show in their progress what the North
and West can do to improve them. With ever lessening
numbers in the South, they will the better respond
to their environment, which will be the better
for such lessening. The result will be the advance
of all to a better condition and a higher plane of
thought.</p>
